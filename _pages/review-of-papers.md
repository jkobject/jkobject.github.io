## neural coding  Peter latham

neurons send and receive outputs which noise can be correlated meaning that there is in fact information in it. This can have a huge effect when looking at big number of neurons. We have to knwo the correlation to understand the coding as the neurons do 

the effect of correlation can be expressed as the variation of I_shuffled ( for encoding) & of I_diag for decoding information adn saying if correlation are important in this process. those values can be from 0 to 40% of the total information of the neurons

ICA ?
independent component analysis. if we admit that a signal is composed of multiple independent sources, each of them emitting an information (thus the corresponding random variable expresses Dependant outcomes) It is possible to each sources ( or each independent components) from the signal according to $y = Wx + o$ with W a matrix (like a Neural net) x the input and o the noise. it is part of unsupervised learning of features

## Predicting the sequence specificities of DnA- and RnA-binding proteins by deep learning Brendan Frey

k-mer ?
all the possible substrings of length k that are contained in a string

mini-batch  ?   stochastic gradient descent ?
In gradient descent algorithms, you can calculate the sum of gradients with respect to several examples and then update the parameters using this cumulative gradient. 
If you ‘see’ all training examples before one ‘update’, then it’s called full batch learning. 
If you use only one example, it’s called stochastic gradient descent (online learning). 
If you use a small batch of examples, it’s called mini-batch learning.

## Deep-learning-free Text and Sentence Embedding  --Sanjeev Arora
[link](http://www.offconvex.org/2018/06/17/textembeddings/)

like word2vec but for phrases

- you weight each word by its inverse smoothed frequency
- you sum the weighted vectors 
- you remove the component that is present in any possible phrases (corresponds to points etc..)

to produce phrases you have a discourse vector representing the subject
and you have a proba function of a vector appearing at pos t given discourse vector. ct moves as a random walk

## How do we capture structure in relational data --Sanjeev

we want to have a representation of the vertices (points) that is similar
when vertices pertain to a similar neighborhood do this by learning a representation that allows us to guess what will be the next given the preceding in a random walk

with node2vec there is 2 ways to look at neighborhoods (homophily or structural) and you can interpolate between the two with 2 hyper params

## Cancer Metastasis Detection With Neural Conditional Random Field --Yi Li

we want to use an information of the neighborhood of images the we find by computing an additional term on the inference of each elements according to their similarity/ distance to others and their labels. this creates a differentiable loss function (Conditional Random Field) that allows for fast computations etc. 80% success

## Multi-Omics factor analysis - a framework for unsupervised integration of multi-omic data sets -- Ricard Argelaguet et al.

you integrate each data by doing a PCA on them basically.
but it uses a Latent factor model which is formulated in a bayesian way by Bayesian way. it i able to recover sparse features which explain well the underlying variations in the data and are able to thus predict outcomes in clinical data and importance features in pluripotent cell differentiation
NICE.

It is super efficient computationally (compared to similar methods)

## Analysis of Genomic Sequence Motifs for Deciphering Transcription Factor Binding and Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotic Cells --Valentina Boeva

>A eukaryotic genome contains a variety of structured patterns. A far from exhaustive list of genomic patterns includes (i) tandem repeats and transposable elements, (ii) stretches of GC- or AT-rich sequences (e.g., CpG islands in mammalian genomes), (iii) binding sites of DNA associated proteins (e.g., transcription factor binding sites), (iv) splice sites, and (v) DNA and RNA binding sites of non- coding RNA molecules. Different patterns may overlap each other. Therefore, although this review is focused on motifs for transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), we provide a short overview of other types of genomic patterns.

This is an overview of the different Trans Fact Bind Sites TFBS and the Motifs Repeats, AT-GC rich sequences, splice sites, miRNA binding sites, techniques and DB to use, find, retrieve known or unknownTFBS.

_contains DB links to unknown DB of PWM motifs for TFBS_

discovery of Shadow binding sites that are low affinity binding sites that alone are not capable of retaining the TF long enough to ensure activation/repression, but instead are used to maintain a high concentration of TF in the vicinity of the primary binding sites


## GPU Kernels for Block-Sparse Weights --Scott Gray, openAI

increasing drastically computation speed on NN with blocks of zero valued weights, allowing to deepen or widen dense NN for same computational efficiency and better accuracy.

They use LSTMs with internal networks and connects them according to the small world paradigm (very good results)

--> would be nice to learn the sparsity structure
according to a predefined sparsity structure, a small world and block sparse  property

Available on tensorflow ops.
(best use multiples of 32x32 and small float values 16 bits etc..
best minibatch is 64 (for cache dilution)

How to embed a node from a network using a flexible notion of neighborhood (from random walks)

able to classify predict ... from this representation, which involves just creating an encoding matrix that is learnt by asyncSGD by trying to predict the neighborhood given the representation 


*questions*

What if we set out to encode not solely the local neighborhood but also some information of the distant neighborhood considering the prior that the network has the small world property?


## MicroRNA signature analysis in colorectal cancer: identification of expression profiles in stage II tumors associated with aggressive disease --Kah Hoong Chang

_touse_

Very High quality paper with a demonstration that 3 circulating miRNA

## Efficient and Robust Automated Machine Learning --Matthias Feurer, Freiburg University

they build on the work of auto weka to solve the CASH optimization (hyperparams and model) problem, to create state of the art algo with sota performance using a tree based Bayesian method (random forest based) called SMAC. They improve this model by having a first instantiation step using meta learning: they have a model that have learnt what are the best instantiation for a given dataset using meta feature of the dataset such as entropy, number of points, classes etc... .
and secondly they use an ensembl of their best algo and not just one

## Vicus: Exploiting local structures to improve network-based analysis of biological data -- Bo Wang, Serafim Batzoglou

_touse_


They propose a new method to the manifold learning problem (dim reduction, clustering, classification etc..) Which uses local dimension learning to do its magic instead of the usual laplacian eigenvectors which learn comparing global euclidean distances.

It is basically the same thing as the laplacian but only it is constrained to do its computation on a local subgraph of close by datapoints

_contains DB links to unknown DB of single cell RNA (12-15, 24)_

## Active learning of cortical connectivity from two-photon imaging data --Mart ́ın A. Bertra ́n, Duke Uni

using bi photon imaging to look at a set of neuron activities and inferring some networks of connections given some stimulus using active learning. 
Basically, what edge should be added to the network that would maximize the likelihood of the model. (edges are weighted)
They model it with a GLM trying to optimize the BIC value of the model. to find whether promising edges to be added can be, it tries to drive the spiking rate of the model up.


## Finding Syntax in Human Encephalography with Beam Search --John Hale, Oxf, DeepMind

>a pattern of results recommends the RNNG+beam search combination as a mechanistic model of the syntactic processing that occurs during normal human language comprehension

RNNG are generative models (here for text) that rely on RNN. they can create a sentence or form a grammar tree of words given a sentence, a tree that you can parse within using beam search this parsing gives you information such as word surprisal and you can use these different statistics given the tree to generate different phrases that will create a predictable effect on the human brain meaning the way their syntax is generated is predictable of the human language comprehension. 

The guys basically made a point in cognitive neuroscience using ANN and advanced computer science. __MADNESS__

## GLOW: FLow based generative network --OpenAI

It is a particular kind of generative NN that is fully reversible thus encode^-1 == decode it is like an auto-encoder but without the re parametrization trick and with a latent space that is the same size as the input space. in the latent space you just have a multi dim Gaussian you can then interpolate to generate new inputs. 
(costly to train though)

## Prediction of acute myeloid leukemia risk in healthy individuals --Eran Segal, Moritz Gerstung

age-related clonal haematopoiesis is a phenomenon is a phenomenon that exists during aging but also is an indicator of AML 7yr before getting it (leukemia form). Here they try to differentiate between the two using deep sequencing methods they find a group of SNPs and markers in parts of the sequences that explains together much of the data but not enough separately. they then did the same on regular blood samples of patients and have seen that information on the size of hematopoetic cells (blood) have a correlation with age related diseases but also pre AML conditions. thus enabling a first easy screening of risky patients.

## A synthetic-diploid benchmark for accurate variant-calling evaluation -- Mc Arthur

trying to create a new benchmark for variant calling tools (matching reads to a reference genome and inferring the SNPs) this is faster than de novo WGS which is super costly and long. (this is part of NGS) they use a particular type of cell lines (human) called CHM which are diploids but fully homozygous and allows to use PACbio sequences without mixing the two genomes

## Meta-analysis of the diagnostic and clinical utility of genome and exome sequencing and chromosomal microarray in children with suspected genetic diseases -- Michelle Clark

A literature and statistical review of 10 years of genomics medicine for infant genetic diseases diagnostics. better use WES/WGS than previous method called CMA (molecular analysis) better sequence infant and 2 parents as well than jsut infant. a lot of heterogeneity and thus. take stats in this study with a grain of salt.

## Multi-scale deep tensor factorization learns a latent representation of the human epigenome -- Jacob Schreiber UW

_touse_

let's create an embedding of all epigenomics data. "Avocado" 
_quality article_
>o high-throughput assay is perfectly reproducible, and run-to-run differences in the same experiment may reflect either biological variation in the cells being assayed or experimental variance arising from sample preparation or downstream steps in the protocol. Finally, many epigenomic assays are highly redundant with one another, and many cell types are closely related to each other, leading to highly redundant measurements

--> so Embeddings
factorize an incomplete 3D matrix of epigenetic features into 3 2D matx of different feature types (pos, assays, cells), concatenating features for each pos on the matrix and passing through 2 * 2048 dense layers NN.

maybe try to train on predicting different features to have more generalization
train on ENCODE instead of RoadMap.. etc.
is it fully differentiable ?
How is the vector factorization working?
how is it constrained?
...

further improvement such as duplicate, divide, erase, destroy, 3D... needs to be achieved

## Personal clinical history predicts antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infections -Yelin,Snitser,Novich

Using Israel's DB and stat explore they have shown that there is relation to many parameter from urinary tracks infection and other factors and related them to biological known factors. using those predictive factors, one would be able to predict the risk of such infection and to prevent it. Among the interesting factors, relation with location (old age institute etc) pharmaceutical history, cross relations eg between age/sex. 

## Deciphering regulatory DNA sequences and noncoding genetic variants using neural network models of massively parallel reporter assays - Rajiv Movva, Kundaje

_touse_

We can see how using a NN model trained to predict regulatory effects of SNP on non coding sequences from Multi array analysis datasets works well. It was used together with SNPs found in GWAS for some genetically correlated cardiac diseases. some interesting results but MPRA dataset is of poor quality in general (low correlation)
Big step forward thought.

tried to regress human traits values (waist, hips, height, bone
106 heel mineral density (BHMD), body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP)) using MLP, CNN & LR over SNPs from WGAS. 
*very stupid idea if you ask me. it is not how CNN are supposed to work. It is really treating DL as magic here*

## Learning Graph-Level Representation for Drug Discovery -- Junying Li et. al.

They use GCN to extract embeddings from a network representing atoms linked together (i.e. a molecule). They use a dummy super node to represent the entire molecule in one feature and they are able to classify the molecule between ones that works and ones that don't

_touse_

multiplier is a method of using Plier (an NMF method to extract features related to gene interactions) on a large compendium of data from many gene interaction modification in multiple diseased over multiple tissues from MicroArray data. learning on a huge multivariate dataset allows the unsupervised embeddings to be richer and more precise in what they convey. They demonstrated that they were able to find feature (and thus genetic interactions for many different complex diseases. the model tries also to make similar vectors from similar tissues and diseases, aligned.

## Allele-specific binding of RNA-binding proteins reveals functional genetic variants in the RNA -- Ei-Wen Yang, Jae Hoon Bahn

_eCLIP-Seq_

GV of diseases DB:
_GWAS, COSMIC, ClinVar, CIVIC and iGAP_

_touse_


A method to find Allele specific binding events using eCLIP-seq data (trancriptome-wide protein RNA interaction data) which gives enough data to do it in an allele specific manner, the method filters out biases in the data and appears to give SOTA results. It predicted functional SNV and how they act as regulators from direct observation instead of correlation inference
"we expect that allele-specific analyses of eCLIP will be an essential approach to deciphering the function of non-coding variants in the RNA."

## In silico prediction of high-resolution Hi-C interaction matrices --Shilu Zhang1, Deborah Chasman.

_touse_

## Winner-Take-All Autoencoders -- Brendan Frey

winner-take-all spatial and lifetime sparsity methods to train auto-encoders that learn to do fully-connected and convolutional sparse coding which jointly trains the encoder and decoder paths by direct back-propagation, and does not require an iterative EM-like optimization technique during training. sota results especially when doing semi supervised training

## Dissecting splicing decisions and cell-to-cell variability with designed sequence libraries -- Eran Segal, Martin Mikl

rationally designed libraries, consisting of altogether 32,789 variants, to address fundamental questions in splicing regulation considering the process in its entirety, from the processing of the RNA to the level of the final functional gene product. They could reproducibly detect even small changes in splicing ratios and quantitatively predict splicing of novel variants with high accuracy (R2 between 0.76 and 0.85)
cells evolved to have seemingly “suboptimal” splice sites, which maximizes the potential for dynamic regulation, but can also serve to ensure optimality at the level of protein isoforms. They have established an assay that is able to assess the cell-to-cell variability of splicing decisions in large scale by measuring the protein output of alternative isoforms and shown that the level of stochasticity can be encoded in the DNA.

## Cancer archetypes co-opt and adapt the transcriptional programs of existing cellular states -- Maayan Baron1, Isabella S. Kim

__quality paper__

study of the gene expression of individual cancer cells in zebrafish and human melanomas. three recurring gene expression patterns across melanoma cancer cells which we refer to as ‘archetypes’ because they appear to be co-opted cellular states with distinct spatial location
cancer cells between human and zebrafish melanomas exhibit the same transcriptional program.
not yet purview into the origin of archetypes. found cooperation across cancer cell lines as they form a tumor in vivo

## Deep learning sequence-based ab initio prediction of variant effects on expression and disease risk -- Troyanskaya, FI
__addition of the second paper "Predicting effects of noncoding variants with deep learning–based sequence model",__ especially the method part of it.

_touse_

they have used a deep CNN with a lot of different Weighted patterns to predict regulatory profile (chromatin, methylation etc...) from a raw DNA sequence. using ENCODE datasets given specific cell types. this gave them the ability to predict a cell specific profile as well as to predict variation in regulatory profiles caused by variants, using a linear model (made from non linear basis function of the different profiles data, they are able to regress how much each the regulatory features of the non coding sequence before the Transcription Start Site (and a bit of the sequence after) influence the expression profile of different gene.) they were able to retrieve expression for famous protein and how they change with different cells and to retrieve SNPs causing variation in expression that were also shown from GWAS information (even better than in GWAS) and to find interesting disease correlations as well.

## One-Shot Imitation Learning -- Ilya Sutskever, Pieter Abbeel

a paper displaying the use of DQN with two distinct networks, one with an attentional mechanism (LSTLM) that sets a set of subtasks to achieve the objective, one to control the robot given the subtasks(MLP) (or even just reconstruct the sets of tasks given the final state it needs to achieve) Here the attentional system helps to subdivide the sets of tasks given to the MLP, results are SOTA for the type of tasks (first to achieve that) 

## MCM2 promotes symmetric inheritance of modified histones during DNA replication -- Nataliya Petryk, Maria Dalby

_not very interesting_

special sequencing technique revealed that parental histone segregation is almost symmetrical with a weak inherent preference for the leading strand. making it possible for MCM2 to recycle parental histones to the lagging strand (Fig. 3F, right), while a separate pathway deposits pa- rental histones on the leading strand. In this vein, it is conceivable that histone segregation can be regulated during development to drive asymmetric cell fates.

## Deep surveying of alternative splicing complexity in the human transcriptome by high-throughput sequencing -- Qun Pan, Ofer Shai, Frey

_old article_ 2008

explaining how the splicing complexity can be understood using RNA seq and how there may be a lot of possible transcripts from one sequence with different alternative splicing according to some regulatory sequences. one interesting aspect is that it shows how much there is and the amount we did not really knew about previously.

## Sequential regulatory activity prediction across chromosomes with convolutional neural networks. --David R. Kelley, Yakir A. Reshef

_touse_

bassenji is another DL algorithm to quantify regulatory features (certain - DNase seq, histone, Chip-seq) from CAGE experiments. it is using a CNN with expending layers (which multiply the ROI by a factor of 2 at each layers). it is from 16 month ago and appears to be less good than more recent work but provide trainings for coverage, GC%, EM for multi-reading alignment etc..
It shows link to eQTL found similarities and GWAS data, perform prediction of why some diseases happens etc, while preventing bias from LD. finally it is giving new research ideas (more data, finding more distant reg activities, better cell specific data, more precise data) and post transcriptional regulation activities etc...

## Deciphering the splicing code --- Yoseph Barash, Frey

_touse_

Kinda the previous version to deepBind. Here they describe an information theoretic method based on regression for prediction of variation of splicing probabilities compared to the baseline activity. this is used by taking in account typical base patterns that would create specific sec shape or bindings for the splicing to happen in a specific manner. This allowed the discovery of new features that make alternative splicing possible and of variation in different tissue with phenotypic logics behind.

## IMPALA -- DeepMind

A new DeepQN framework for the in parallel training of multiple actors and diminishing the delay/dissimilarity between the actors and the learners (and the learners to themselves) this framework/architecture is made possible by a new learning method that tries to combat the off policy (dissimilarity in policy) between the different agents. it uses previous work on batch A2C, Importance sampling, and other mathematically/experimentally driven techniques to compute the best possible gradient for episodes (a,s,r). 

## Unsupervised embedding of single-cell Hi-C data - Jie Liu, Galip Gurkan Yardımcı, UW

a paper displaying how one can use a previous technique called HiCRep which smooths the Hi-C contact matrix and then computes a weighted similarity measure separately at each genomic distance. Then averages the results for the cell itself. Finally followed by a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) of the resulting matrix to reduce the dimensionality while preserving distance relations, allows to recover angle distance between datapoints (representing cells) which allows the classification of different cell phases. It can be done with high throughput scHiC data since using a subset of contacts still allows to recover the ground truth, especially if used in combination with a bag  of more deeply sequenced cells.

## The Tsetlin Machine - A Game Theoretic Bandit Driven Approach to Optimal Pattern Recognition with Propositional Logic -- Granmo

the tsetlin machine is a form of machine learning techniques which uses tsetlin automaton the same way a neural network uses a neuron. However it is more computationally grounded by being in the framework of propositional logic. The paper shows how to reach an equilibrium in learning even from very noisy data by finding the right hyperparameter handling error assignment. it proves that it will be able to learn anything and then shows some sota results on some datasets.

	Since most of variant associated with phenotypic changes in mammals are from non coding region, the paper establishes the different mode of genetic variation mediated changes to TF binding. sets up the ways in which they have previously been uncovered, some examples and the difficulties behind this problem. It then goes on to highlight the possible technological (sequencing & computational(ML))-based techniques that might help in solving it.


## SegAnnDB interactive Web-based genomic segmentation --Hocking

a less interesting paper that reuses a mathematical framework to help on analysis (segmentation) of cancer genomes into different categories (CN variation, breakpoints(DNA deleted, inverted, or swapped)) by using a mathematical+vision framework to understand the user input segmentation and further them to the entirety of the cell genome in a supervised fashion.  

## Defining a Cancer Dependency Map -- Aviad Tsherniak, Francisca Vazquez, Phil G. Montgomery BroadInstitute

Researchers from CDS team at the broad present their ongoing effort to analyze a wide range of cancer cell lines to infer their dependencies (survival, reproduction) on different genes. To do so they are using genome scale loss of function RNAi screens (knocking down specific genes using silencing RNA which will get infiltrated by lentiviral infection in vitro on microArray live cell chips which is highly multiplexed (looking at the expression of the co-infected GFP RNA in each cases)). Each input RNA (shRNA ~100,000) will infect some cells and silence some genes. They contain a seed which will help in the binding to the desired mRNA.  
However, Because of this seed, this will also create off target effects (down-regulating other genes than the desired one by partial binding of the miRNA seed) it is using a linear regression model to understand the true effect of each shRNA in silencing a particular gene. (The model was in fact very similar in intuition to a NMF but was just a linear regression: to divide the dataset (cell line perturbation per shRNA) into two distinct part: cell line perturbation per gene knock down and cell line perturbation (instead of gene knock down) per shRNA with seed k) <-- could be done in a more efficient fashion by using an NMF which divide it and add a third matrix term which would contain the off target effect relation across shRNAs. 
The two matrix found allow one to understand specific cases where specific cell lines require a particular gene more than another and more than the regular cell. it is called: a differential dependency and might represent important therapeutic target. 
By taking the strongest ones (6std from the mean) they found 769 such genes for the 500 cell lines. they then used another non linear regression model with gene mutations, gene copy number, gene expression from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE).
They then carefully analyzed the different types of predictive MDPs (Marker dependency pairs) and specific MDPs for 86% of the dependencies.
However, to find a full range of MDP and predictive models for each, they estimate they would need to increase the amount of cell lines to >5000, to account for other types of dependencies such as ones that are not single cell specific (but are important in group behavior).
--> moreover, what happen for gene combination effects and in this case, time dependent gene known down effect? is there a non linear relationship between gene knockdown and gene knockoff? what about the many different type of cancer cells and their inter relationship present in a tumor?
how many other features can be added? (long range TF?) can one reuse some pretrained DL for genomic and find what molecular features in the sequence explain each types? 


## Improved estimation of cancer dependencies from large-scale RNAi screens using model-based normalization and data integration -- james McFarland BroadInstitute

*basically about explanaing demeter2*

explaining similar things as previously with a bit more emphasis in the comparative aspect and computational aspect of Demeter2 to other types of data. a larger dataset (790dtp). in the better explanation of the model and its results. interesting and deeper explanation of the computation in the methods:
the demeter2 model uses a Bayesian model with variational inference of some params and MAP estimates of others. it explains the full procedure to infer each params using scipy and Edward. in this model a lot has been used to find the best set of parameters / hyperparameters. comparing with ground truth or prior knowledge and values to set to test the strength of each.


## Genetic and transcriptional evolution alters cancer cell line drug response -- Uri Ben-David1, Benjamin Siranosian, Gavin Ha, Helen tang, Yaara Oren, Kunihiko Hinohara, craig Strathdee, Joshua Dempster, Nicholas lyons, robert Burns, Anwesha Nag, Guillaume Kugener, Beth cimini, Peter tsvetkov, Yosef Maruvka1, ryan O’rourke, Anthony Garrity, Andrew tubelli, Pratiti Bandopadhay, Aviad tsherniak

Here we look at the problems arising from the culture of cancer cell lines in research application. because of random mutations, changes in their environment, cancer cell lines undergo evolution. this creates strong differences to the in vivo scenario. The paper tries to infer the possible differences and how they might arise (medium, population bottleneck). They have dev a tool to compute the distance to a reference. They also show how to use this such as to understand cancer cooperation (with single cell seq) and correlation genotype-phenotype. 



## Massively Multilingual Sentence Embeddings for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer and Beyond -- Mikel Artetxe, Holger Schwenk.

It proves to be sota on most test set used. I uses a bi-LSTM encoder of 5 layers, 83 languages and an LSTM decoder  with skip connections 


## CytoGAN: Generative Modeling of Cell Images -- Imaging Platform Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard

this work uses a regular LSGAN to learn the important feature from a dataset of cell images. they show that it is not sota but can infer better latent factors which encode phenotypic information about the cell. both in the generator and discriminator. They show how to preprocess the image to get the best results. the work would need additional information to be reproducible.


## Pathway perturbations in signaling networks: Linking genotype to phenotype --Babu for Barth EPFL

_what about gene knockdown datasets... might be very interesting. 
drug interference data sets as well.
I heard of central regulators which are specific and specifically expressed in specific cancer cell lines and that knowing that information allows one to understand the specificities of the cell line (like its reaction to drugs etc..)_

In here we look at several different signaling pathways which have highly oncogenic potentials. looking at them via a What mutation, how it should work, what happens when mutations. How can it be fixed.
We are really looking at the causal explanation of a phenotype by a mutation/alt. splicing/ translocation/... .

## Pharmacogenomics of GPCR Drug Targets --  Masuho, Leonie J. Jahn, Kirill A. Martemyanov, David E. Gloriam, M. Madan Babu

Here we analyze how different drugs affecting primarily or secondarily the GPCR membrane receptors of cells can have different effects considering the naturally occurring mis-sense variation in the human population on these corresponding protein coding genes.

_how comme they never thought of doing the same in pharmacollogy??_
_what about the non coding variants in the population it will reflect also some differential effects in the signaling pathway and even variation in the proportion of membrane receptors_

###  Quantifying codon usage in signal peptides: Gene expression and amino acid T usage explain apparent selection for inefficient codons

I had the time to read the papers you sent me and they were very good. The third one presented a great introduction to CUB and a good model which attains a very high score. I would guess that this model could not get the same score for other species. I still think that a model of CUB would always be reductionist as the CUB is a proxy for so many different processes and adaptations of the cell. The many fine grained Bayesian model that you present however seems to make sense and creating a model is to me the only way to test a theory. The ability to regress values such as the protein synthesis rate is impressive and it does not seem trivial to me that this should be the case. The model that you have developed seems very suited for answering questions about the CUB as shown for example in "quantifying codon usage in signal peptides".

## Mammalian Genes Are Transcribed with Widely Different Bursting Kinetics

in this paper it is explained briefly (with more precision about the models in the supplementary materials) the rational behind bursting kinetics in mamlian genes. We look at a model going from in/activation; trancription rates; translation rates and degradations. using markovian prob. models. per coding genes. then correlates it with exeperimental fluo activity thanks to a poissonian noise model. the entirety of the model is then parametrized by EM algo thx to baum welsh algorithm. the computation of the states (bc it is a markov. model.) is done with the viterbi algorithm. The signal in the images were deconvolved using wavelet temporal analysis. the results described how different profiles of protein activity were highly periodic with different types of kinetics. also shown in the analysis of the states/params of the model for different mRNA. this difference could be seen also for similar genes accross cell lines.

## what are super enhancers? -- Sebastian Pott & Jason D Lieb
_very important_

Explainingwhat are enhancers. open questions about them at the functional level.
then turns out how to compute super enhancers. their possible differences with regular ones and possible similarity which would make them just reegular enhancers specific of the particular expression of the cell line.
it turns out to display 5 questions about super enhancer and if they truly are mechanistically different.
And a framework to find it out.

_how do gene dependancy relate to SEn? using the same Crispr screening technique
One Should Compute SEn without using merging of regular one according to the paper. Might help answering the question as well_

## Super-Enhancers in the Control of Cell Identity and Disease -- Denes Hnisz, Brian J. Abraham, Tong Ihn Lee
_very important_


_might be interesting to reuse softs such as DeepPeakCaller and DeepBind_

_Maybe one might find the equivalent of superENhancer for lesser TF type when looking only at these._

_Sen are concepts associated with TF master TF, enhancer, cell fate, cell differenciation/pluripotency (see for of Pr. Gioele La manno EPFL, transcription regulation (cis & trans) (also via enhancerRNAs), _

_it would be valuable to identify the master transcription factors that control all cell states._

_if alteration in superenhancer drive cell specificity. what if some cancer were some form of local valley in cell specificity out of which the cell can't escape. this could be seen by looking at differences in superenhancer region through stages of cancer or types of cancer from a same cell line through the eyeyes of what La Manno has done._

_when you look at Senh accross cell lines and cancers and you see ~ a thiord which are cell line specific. do the other 2/3 are shared accross cell? cell types? cell groups? random noise, i.e. not acual Senh?_

First the discovery that super enhancer are linked with cancer hallmark, disease SNPs, specific per cell types, linked with specific core transcription factors, miRNA ncRNA. might explain cell diff, fate, etc.. they create feedback loop. can be transcribed into eRNA (which may contribute to gene activation) and are not only enriched in TF but also in RNA Polymerase II, Cofactors, and Chromatin Regulators.

## Selective Inhibition of Tumor Oncogenes by Disruption of Super-Enhancers -- Jakob Love, Heather A. Hoke, Charles Y. Lin

You have some enhancer of MYC, MCL1, IRF4, PRDM1 ... which are strongly bound by BRD4 and MED1. we know that reducing the level of BRD4 by using a JQ1 tratment which will lead to a bromodomain inhibition of BRD4 and thus restrict binding of itself and its coFactors. In many types of cancer cells. this leads to a selective desctruction of them and not of regular cells. This is explained in this paper by stating that these cells are known to have very strong super enhancers to these genes and thus it is places which relies more heavily on BRD4 and which are more essential to these cell lines. Giving ideas to explain and discover more oncogenic targets.

## ATARiS: Computational quantification of gene suppression phenotypes from multisample RNAi screens-- Diane D. Shao, Aviad Tsherniak, Shuba Gopal, Barbara A. Weir

## A Landscape of Pharmacogenomic Interactions in Cancer-- Francesco Iorio, Theo A. Knijnenburg, Daniel J. Vis

A look at the pharmacogenomic landscape (response to 265 drugs) of 1,001 human cancer cell lines from 11,289 tumors points to new treatment applications for hundreds of known anti-cancer drugs. to determine:
- the extent to which cancer cell lines recapitulate oncogenic alterations in primary tumors.
- which oncogenic alterations associate with drug sensitivity, 
- whether logic combinations of multiple alterations better explain drug sensitivity.
- the relative contribution of different molecular data types, either individually or in combination, in predicting drug response

_here it seems that the gene expression data only helps to infer the cell type > thus the dependancy according to that. thus a two step model (cell type > specific sensitivity) might be more appropriate_
_Here I think you need to model some of the specific proteins to understand better what explains the sensitivity and what events (SNP, CNV, ...) might help you understand that. (see work from Patrick Barth)_

## Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction-- Deepak Pathak Pulkit Agrawal

_what about training on the ability to predict the distribution dynamics instead of just prediction error on the next state (else might be triggered by simple noise or stochastic distributions)_

agent is trained on minimizing the prediction error of state t+1 from state t and action t (_may be better with reusing all previous states in some form_)

_"the agent will be completly unperturbed by external factors" yet it seems very delicate for the agent to understand what will have future effect on him down the road. I guess the human brain does not do it this way._

_They should have tried to do parameters sharing._

## Master Transcription Factors and Mediator Establish Super-Enhancers at Key Cell Identity Genes-- Warren A. Whyte,1,4 David A. Orlando,1,4 Denes Hnisz

Very similar to the previous papers about super enhancers. Most of the new finding is in the title. 

>Super-enhancer formation appears to occur as a conse- quence of binding of large amounts of master transcription factors to clusters of DNA sequences that are relatively abundant across these large domains. Theses domains featiure CDS which are the core constituent of Cell Identity.


_it seems that super enhancers activate cell identity by the type of genes they bind to. However it seems that it is always the same master. What plays on the differences? (initial parameters/ TF concentration?/other non master TF) can we reprogram cells using these TF value?_

_given that cancer seems to be something that evolves really quickly over time from a regular cell (which in case of children might have a propension to go so). what about using a flow model on the cell's transcriptomics/genomic to understand the flow of cancerisation as a differenciation. You could see it going to a probabilistic valley with canyons and taking a path which will increase the likelyhood of turning into a cancer. Then, why not look at the cell before it become a full on cancer and see the possible differences in pathway and create things that attack cells in this particular state._

## The Hallmarks of Cancer-- Douglas Hanahan* and Robert A. Weinberg

the foundationnal paper presenting the 6 hallmarks of cancer:
- limitless replication
- evading apoptosis
- insensitivity to antigrowth signals
- self sufficiency in growth signals
- tissue invasion (metastasis)
- sustained angiogenesis
 via a suite of possible mechanism.

showing that cancer should not happen with this likely hood but that instead cells when loosing specific sets of reparing/stability genes or phagocytosising cells (which may incorporate some instable DNA)) may undergo, with much more likelyhood: cancer.

> we look ahead 10 or 20 years to the time when the diagnosis of all the somatically acquired lesions present in a tumor cell genome will become a routine procedure. By then, genome-wide gene expression profiles of tumor cells will also be routine. With all this information in hand, it will become possible to test definitively our proposition that the development of all types of human tumor cells is governed by a common set of rules such as those implied by the six acquired capabilities enumerated here.

## Generating Focussed Molecule Libraries for Drug Discovery with Recurrent Neural Networks-- Marwin HS Segler1, Thierry Kogej, Christian Tyrchan and Mark P Waller

using an RNN generator very similar to the ones used modelling language, to model molecules (no conformation, only placement). althought this work is nice and highlights what can be done with substantial results to show. it may lack information on conformation and it does not seem to use every information available to biochemists. It uses transfer learning and a measure of fitness which allows it to be efficient. it gives some informations of the goals in this field. 

It may be problematic however that it does not provide radically new molecules but quite similar ones. ways to present and tests such data does not seem to be present yet. The author do present good future work ideas and skepticism.

## Precision Targeting of BFL-1/A1 and an ATM Co- dependency in Human Cancer-- Rachel M. Guerra, Gregory H. Bird, Edward P. Harvey

> Guerra et al. constructed an exquisitely selective BFL-1 inhibitor capable of covalent BFL-1 targeting and cellular penetrance without membrane disruption. Mining a genetic dependency database revealed a spectrum of BFL-1 dependency in cancer and an ATM co- dependency in AML, prompting the combination of BFL-1 and ATM inhibitors to achieve synergistic cytotoxicity.

*I don't understood all the nuances of the paper, especially the design and thought process displayed in the results.*

*The papeer could have needed a bit more explanation on the underlying process it is trying to solve (schematics to avoid repeating long enumeration of action of protein)*


Here the author reuse and modify a NOXA protein to create one that will very specifically bind and inhibate BFL1 (with D-NA (at N term)) and thus reactivate the apoptotic route of the cell. They use staple peptide to consolidate the protein SAHB15 and subsequently modified aa for less hydrophobic ones to create a protein that could enter the cells without destroying them. they then undertakent to test variation, precision etc.. of this protein to confirm its pharmacological relevance in BFL1 and ATM co dependant ccl

> • What is the spectrum of nucleotide- and dinucleotide-level changes associated with different carcinogenic etiologies (for example, tobacco, pathogens or inflammation) operating in different parts of the body?
• Will integration of additional data sources, including additional tumor types from TCGA and other projects, increase the power of analysis in useful ways?
• How can characterization based on molecular changes complement pathological analysis for classification of cancers into tumor lineages with potentially different clinical management?
• Can molecular profiles effectively categorize cancers for therapeutic decision-making?
• Are there predictive expression-based signatures for genomic events that transcend tissues, reflecting pathways disrupted by the alterations?
• Will comprehensive protein analysis through emerging mass spectrometry approaches in the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and other efforts extend the power of the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in TCGA?
• Will whole genome analysis demonstrate the influence of mobile elements, mutations in non-coding regions and connections to constitutional risk-associated loci?
• How are changes in protein families distributed across different tumor types?
• Are aberrations in specific protein domains or pathways distributed differentially across tumor lineages?
• Beyond the known examples, including in cervical, head and neck, esophageal and hepatocellular cancers, can we identify other cancer types that show virally mediated initiation?
• Are bacteria associated with different cancer lineages (as Fusobacteria are in colorectal cancer43)?
• Can the answers to any of these questions help in the design of novel therapies and clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes?

## Pan-cancer network analysis identifies combinations of rare somatic mutations across pathways and protein complexes-- Mark D M Leiserson, Fabio Vandin, Hsin-Ta Wu, Jason R Dobson


a network analysis using a heat diffusion model accross network of interconnected genes identifies mutation (heat) that display important network for the cancers accross thousands of cancer and tens of cancer types. this analysis focus on 3 interesting pathways: 
- SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex
- BAP1 complex
- cohesin and condensin complexes
- MHC class I proteins
- the telomerase complex

they also found 92 mutated gene with usually low score in non networked single gene analysis

It might be used on any gene data with a value measure for each gene!

*Q: How do they guess link to cancer from only presence in the netwtork?*

*N: why don't we stop looking at what is mutated and start looking at what is not mutated? like looking at what specific circuitry cancers rely upon to stay alive, that other regular cells might not need?*

Knowing that there is evidence for increaser in variability of expression accross cell lines in the human genome with age. Researchers looked at brain cells (frontal/pre frontal) and discovered a slight increase in the variability of expression accross different techniques (measures of variations, comparisons)
They *most importantly* did a go search and discovered that this increase in variability was mostly for genes related to 
ageing processes.

## STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner--PacBio

star is the first and most used algorithm specifically designed for aligning rna seq data (especially paired end reads) from 3rd gen sequencer (longer reads). it is 30 times faster than previous algo and uses a two step algo:
- seed searching (Maximal mappable array) implemented through uncompressed suffix arrays which account for mismatches, low quality read ends, multiple solutions and gaps (introduced by splicing)
- Clustering, stitching and scoring based on proximity of each read, accounting for overlapping reads and distant reads based on a user provided threshold

It can also be used as a generative model from the weights learnt from each gene
>Taking advantage of this module, we have deter- mined that a large number of short SE reads is best for gene-level quantification, while PE reads may improve within-gene isoform frequencies for the mouse and human transcript sets.

## Network-based inference of protein activity helps functionalize the genetic landscape of cancer-- Mariano J. Alvarez, Yao Shen, Federico M. Giorgi, Califano Lab...

*Aracne outperforms Chip experiments, only with RNA seq data*
-> does not get the same information thought: Regulators and regulons is different from TFB and DNA acetylation
Knowing regulons (genesets regulated by a regulator) we can then express a set of statistical analysis whereby looking at rna seq data, estimating the effect of regulons, from the expression of genes and of regulators of these genes. trying to remove other effects. this is done by comparing RNAseq to other batches of RNA seq to get predictive power. Then can be used Enrichment analysis test on ranks of expression to determine the effect of specific genes on regulons and specific regulons on genes. This acts as a network inference of "protein" (not really) "activity" 
An interesting thing is to be able to infer mutations that are likely to cause up or down regulation effect in this network. (CCLE)

All in all it tries to unsupervisely attain the same result as CRC analysis (it might get btw more predictive power if using a hiererchical system based on CRCs(and here you need ChIP))

Using mutation scans where mutating and translating an rna will lead to a protein of a likely different affinity to a kown bindinig protein. If the change of two position leads to a different change expected from adding the unique change at these two positions. Then we expect the two regions to be near each other in the protein.
Using that they were able to prove that it works for region of highest increase. But did not show recreation of known protein structure from this data. 


## Deep learning at base-resolution reveals motif syntax of the cis-regulatory code-- Kundaje lab

> These results indicate that while local sequence context (1 kb) is sufficient to accurately capture the shape of ChIP-nexus profiles and positions of binding footprints, longer sequences or other measurements such as local chromatin state may be required to better predict TF occupancy (45)

Using a CNN with deconv layer in the end to predict binding profile from sequence based on chip exo data (like chip seq but on a per bp basis). They found it learnt syntax specific binding profile. most of the time unregarding on the cell type (i.e. the current binding profile which is also influenced by the chromatin state). Inspecting the learnt parameters with many toolings and domain knowledge. They could find cooperative binding in step specific manner based on motifs spacing, motif linked to binding of other TFs, matching footprints. They found specific binding to tRNA genes of oct4. influence of transposons and filtering of them based on Information content of the learnt motif instances. periodic patterns in nanog binding showing behavior of nucleosome unwinding. All in all making of rules of the cis regulation syntax shown in theory and some experiment. such as the TF collective model, billboard model enhanceosome model.

It showed a lot of the reasons why and hopes to place the burden of proof to drug companies. to recentrate efforts on understanding MOA and to get more big data information on rnai and use cripr tool as much as possible today.


## Scalable whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA reveals high concordance with metastatic tumors-- Viktor Adalsteinsson, Gavin Ha, Samuel Freeman, Atish Choudhury

IN this document, it is shown that with sufficiently good models of quality of DNA from blood biopsies, it is possible to achieve very similar results to regular DNA analysis of biopsies. This is proven by doing correlation analysis and using the data for application of target discovery, neoantigen therapies. Moreover it is shown that by its broad sampling of the body's activity, cfDNA seems to be better in discovering subclonal population and finding mechanism of resistance of these populations, thus allowing better prediction of resistance to therapies

It also contains a diffusion step. It is a mathematical model based on some prior on the data (scRNA like structure and presence of clear clusters). It can be used for as inputs to dim reduction tasks and clustering tasks.  

## UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction--

Umap is a dimensionality reduction algorithm. It takes points defined by vectors of high dimensions: 2D vector= (x,y), 3D vector= (x,y,z), ND vector= (x,y,z,a,b,c,...n). and puts them back in lower dimensions. This allows for visualizing point clouds in 2D and also finding a subspace/ base / manifold in which the cloud data lies. This can be better visualizing in the 3D to 2D case 
This reduced vector is also called an embedding of the first one.

![scikit learn](../../dimred.jpg)
view of learning the shape of a "sheet of paper" only by knowing a set of points that lie on it.

Unlike many other famous techniques ([PCA](https://medium.com/@raghavan99o/principal-component-analysis-pca-explained-and-implemented-eeab7cb73b72), [MDS](d)...) it learns this structure by using local information about the points (neighbors), like [t-SNE](https://medium.com/@raghavan99o/principal-component-analysis-pca-explained-and-implemented-eeab7cb73b72).

Neighbor information is better encoded into a graph with edges representing distances to nearest points.

This distance is normalized by all distances this point has to its neighbors.

then for all the neighbors we create a set (a list of unique things): for all the edges. this set will be fuzzy as it also contains a value representing how much each neighbors is in the set of neighbors based on its distance to the center point.

We will then merge all the sets created for each point.
i.e. we will then merge the edges and keep only the ones with the lowest distances.

We then take each edges and considers them together as a graph.

*Note that we are thinking here about graph of nodes and edges but the topological logic could be applied to the faces made by each set of 3 edges and the volumes made by each set of 4 faces, etc ...*

We then take the core components of this graph using [spectral embedding](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_cluster_comparison.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-cluster-comparison-py), where we basically take the [eigenvector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g) of a [matrix of adjacency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) (a square of numbers where rows represent the nodes of the graph and the columns represent the same thing and the values of the matrix are the distance between, each point)

It is a [decomposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g) of the information into two things, one that define a base for the object to exist in and the other defining the layout of the object. you need both to reconstruct the object.

Here we will only take the first 2 most important value of the base and considers it as what defines our object in 2 dimension (it can be any number lower than the initial number of dimension). The two values here are the dimensions and their dimensions are each of the different points

Finally we will try to improve this first version by a [minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) process. There, we want to apply a physical-like force between the nodes so that close connected edges get closer together (up to a minimum distance)


![](../../images/umap.png) 
we can see the relation to the number of samples used and the max distance to create graph edges.

All in all, there is a theoretical explanation of the algorithm that can be seen in terms of learning [fuzzy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic) [simplicial sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_set) defining the local structure of the high dimensional data and of the lower dimensional one and making the two sets converge. 

The explanation defined in part 2 of the paper can be understood by anyone after reading [this book](https://books.google.com/books?id=xbL11KfgiEAC&printsec=frontcover&hl=fr&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) which will allow the reader to gain the vocabulary to understand the wikipedia pages defining the vocabulary used in the paper. :p 

More information about Riemannian topology can then be learned [here](http://www.math.ens.fr/~feydy/Teaching/geometrie_riemannienne_espaces_de_formes.pdf). It is in French however ;)


## Reproducible pharmacogenomic profiling of cancer cell line panels-- Peter m. Haverty, Eva Lin, Jenille Tan2, yihong yu...

A presentation of a meta analysis and replication test of large scale pharmacogenomic profiling of CCLs both at sanger and broad by independant panel as a response to another research. It showed that flaws in the critics of the reproducibiliity existed as it was not judging on the full dataset and it was not looking at the same thing as what the large scale studies where interested in.It also shows that it is able to correlate both results by doind the analysis differently and to reproduce them (with more correlation to broad's)


## EZH2 oncogenic mutations drive epigenetic, transcriptional, and structural changes within chromatin domains-- Maria C. Donaldson-Collier1,5, Stephanie Sungalee, EPFL

This group is analysing an oncogenic mutation in a gene which is implied in the presence of histone modification at key location. They show that this mutation cause the presence of this modification everywhere and mostly in some sets of genes that are within Topologically associating domains. They found that the TADs might change a bit based on this modification and thus, change the transcriptional status of genes which are themselves tied to oncogenic states.

## Master Transcription Factors and Mediator Establish Super-Enhancers at Key Cell Identity Genes-- Young Lab

A paper I had already read before discovering and explaining what are super enhancers and how they differ from regular ones. It is in the context of muring ESCs. We can see their analysis by size. location in TAds, circuitry binding to TF and to cell state. cobinding and Mediator content. etc.. 


## DIGGIT: a Bioconductor package to infer genetic variants driving cellular phenotype -- Mariano J. Alvarez, James C. Chen and Andrea Califano

A very small paper. more of an abstract that does not explain the algorithm but shows a way to improve gwas studies by improving QTL estimation based on knowledge of master regulators and impacts of CNV on expression. The paper was not precise enough for me to make any judgment on the logic. It is not a good paper.


## Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 -- Michael I Love, Wolfgang Huber and Simon Anders

Here is a presentation of DESeq2 which improves on the previous version as it is trying to shrink the variance in the data based on the amount of support you get from the data itself. This will reduce the estimate of the fold change based on fitting the data to a NB distribution in a bayesian framework where the estimates of a MaxLikelyhood round are fitted again to a distribution with a prior as a zero centered Normal with a MAP round. The confidence values and the  ah ok ones pass a Wald Test which provide a z stat.

## TADs as the caller calls them-- Elzo de Wit

An approach to TADs consisting as a litterature review and opinion on the origin of TADs (as extrusion of cohesin loops) and their actual mechanisms. It serves as to diminish certain claims about the role of the TADs and precise their existence as a readout of a specific biological process. Instead of as a specific process themselves.  


## UNDERSTANDING AND IMPROVING INTERPOLATION IN AUTOENCODERS VIA AN ADVERSARIAL REGULARIZER-- David Berthelot, Ian Goodfellow...

This paper presented a novel strategy to better constraint the results of an autoencoder by enforcing it to produce a smooth transition between its learnt representations. This is done by using an adversarial procedure whereby a critic is trying to predict the interpolation amount and the encoder has to make the critic think that it is 0. This can help better learning the manifold of the data as shown in toy examples and MNIST results. However seems to still have some caveats in its current form.


## Transcriptional Amplification in Tumor Cells with Elevated c-Myc-- Charles Lin, Young Lab

A paper that shows that a contrario to other TFs, cMYC promotes the expression of all expressed genes but not unexpressed ones and thus serves as a general amplifier of expression in a cell. Explaining its upregulation in many cancer genomes. <-- Has been shown as wrong in the paper SLAM-seq defines direct gene-regulatory functions of the BRD4-MYC axis

## SLAM-seq defines direct gene-regulatory functions of the BRD4-MYC axis-- Matthias Muhar, Anja Ebert

A paper using slamseq to show that MYC only regulates a set of house keeping genes which can however appear as a global down-regulator/upregulator on less precise time scales. 

## Transcription Factors Activate Genes through the Phase-Separation Capacity of Their Activation Domains-- Ann Boija, Isaac A. Klein, Benjamin R. Sabari, Young's lab

Here is presented a work showing how the TF/Co-activator transcriptional condensate is organized and composed. This allows for a precise experimental definition of this condensate and its interaction in ESCs and shows how this could explain the MLL TFtoANY fusion proteins by the reliation of this condensate on proteins disordered regions which promotes this low level interaction between one another and the formation of condensate between TFsxCoact

What is the problem of the drugability gap (what we now as oncogenic and what we can drug). How to do a "Human Cancer Genome"? Work on the understanding and targeting of resistance (by attacking the pathways in multiple locations). How to better use disease models (by high number of them and better model like GEM). And how that might translate to other diseases.

## Genome-wide somatic variant calling via colored debrujin graphs- Giuseppe Narzisi 1, André Corvelo1, Kanika Arora

This is a new tool, similar to strelka2 which does not yet work on tumor only. It also shows a great analysis of the performance of each other main algorithms mutect2/1 strelka2/1 LoFreq.


## AtomNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Bioactivity Prediction in Structure-based Drug Discovery-- atomwise team

Achieves sota results on predicting bioactivity of small molecules in binding sites of proteins, based on a set of bioactivity databases. Issues of measuring quality since AUC is not perfect given the data type. The issue is of using this 3D data and converting it into something that can be used by the algo. Also having very similar inputs with very dissimilar activity (need to correct for this bias and other when processing your data) They are using a 3D small conv net.


## Evaluating Variant Calling Tools for Non-Matched Next-Generation Sequencing Data--
--> for reproducibility little care in speed and overall consitence in accuracy through datasets noise level and read depth, we will still stick to the HaplotypeCaller from the GATK server in tumor only mode.

## Identifying Gene Expression Programs of Cell-type Identity and Cellular Activity with Single-Cell RNA-Seq-- Dylan Kotliar, Adrian Veres, M. Aurel Nagy

They showed that NMF is the better tool overall to detect Genetic expression programs from test scRNAseq data when run many times and combinating the results. They call this combination cNMF. 
> Are they just trying to show me what NMF and bagging is?  


## DeepCpG: accurate prediction of single-cell DNA methylation states using deep learning-- Christof Angermueller1, Heather J. Lee, Wolf Reik

A tools  to impute low-coverage methylation profiles for sets of cells and to discover DNA sequence motifs that are associated with methylation states and cell-to-cell variability from a bi input (CPG | Mut -> GRU | CONV -> FC-> CPG). I would really have wished to see the actual specificity and sensitivity given that the algorithm

## LighCpG: a multi-view CpG sites detection on single-cell whole genome sequence data

It is like deepCpG but using the LightGBM algorithm to make its prediction. Does seem to be somewhat equivalent but faster.

## Massively multiplex chemical transcriptomics at single-cell resolution-- Sanjay R. Srivatsan, José L. McFaline-Figueroa


## Improved protein structure prediction using potentials from deep learning-- DeepMind

finally deepmind presents its alpha fold algorithm and release it. The algorithm is using first MSA based sequence matching (from database) and then uses the first contact estimates, sequence specific information (and BLAST data) and output of a POTTS model as input to a very deep conv net with ELU layers and skip connections to refine the contact map. the predictions are then used by a non-convex differentiable model that will predict actual pairwise distances from the given data (which is: additional input from van der walls forces model, torsion distribution and distance distribution) using gradient descent (muliple trials with different noise input at the first step)    

## PAN CANCER ANALYSIS OF WHOLE GENOME: Broad, Toronto,

### A deep learning system can accurately classify primary and metastatic cancers based

Here researcher are presenting a simple NN trained on mutation features over the largest WGS tumor panel and show that methylation patterns guessed from passenger mutation distribution is very efficient. that sequencer/mut caller difference decrease their accuracy from 90% to 80%. That they can as well predict on metastasis than primary.

## Growth Differentiation Factor 11 Is a Circulating Factor that Reverses Age-Related Cardiac Hypertrophy-- Francesco S. Loffredo, Matthew L. Steinhauser, Steven M. Jay

we can see that GDF-11 seems to be a factor to precent cardiac hypertrophy in aging.
This was an experimental study using proteomic analysis of blood from aged and young mice. doing heterochronic parabiosis and (trying to) controlling for blood pressure and behavioral changes post surgery.

## The Hallmarks of Aging-- Carlos Lopez-Otı Maria A. Blasco, Linda Partridge

We have a good overview showing the main research and knowledge into aging, very similar to cancer hallmark although less insight is available compared to cancer
A must read.

## Predicting Deeper into the Future of Semantic Segmentation--

They are reusing a well known semantic segmentation architexture called Dilation10 and used it in an autoregressive fashion (predicting one frame and the next ...) and compared it to known methods to show that this approach was the most efficient.


## Integrating ChIP-seq with other functional genomics data-- Mortazavi, shiang

## Personalized and graph genomes reveal missing signal in epigenomic data-- Cristian Groza, Tony Kwan, Nicole Soranzo

How using this new tool of personaallized graph genome can hepl in recover missing peaks that are more sample specific. (very important for in depth analysis of a cancer genome for example or when comparing differences across genomes where only a small set of enhancer are different)


## Genetic and transcriptional evolution alters cancer cell line drug response-- Uri Ben David

Very important to CCLE, showing that subclonal evolution has an important impact in cell line's ability to stay similar through time. and that the proportion of these subclones is changing and has a specific impact on our ability to cluster and predict effects for that cell line. 

## Mitochondrial uncoupling and lifespan-- Mookerjee, Divakaruni

How the mitochondira affects aging based on its efficiency decrease with time. Its respirations process is inneficient and produces ROS that will damage it through proton leaks. It has repair mechanisms such as uncoupling (of substrate oxidation from ADP phosphorylation). It is a litterature review of that process and its effect on aging.


## RNA isoform screens uncover the essentiality and tumor-suppressor activity of ultraconserved poison exons

## ENCODE3

the new datasets and results from the ENCODE3 project with around 50000 samples of epigenomes

### Global reference mapping of human transcription factor footprints

how this new dataset of deep openChromatin helped them uncover specific region of activity and TF binding site from footprinting these regions. It created this new set of regulatory elements defining them by their location and binding specificity. It showed how they seemed evolutionnary unconsctrained while still being a big repository of GWAS variant ( folds more than random in the genome)

### A large-scale binding and functional map of human RNA-binding proteins

from this paper we can see

## Occupancy maps of 208 chromatin-associated proteins in one human cell type

First time we have so many bindings data on one sample (still the issue of assuming steady states). But interesting that only require 30 or so proteins to basically predict chromatin state. the rest is redundant. promoter/enhancer distinction is very much not present. A lot of TFs are just present because they bind to others, leading to errors in what have been deemed TFBS. example: "CTCF motif in RAD21". For the 30 CAPs with a described motif, the majority of peaks did not contain a primary motif, a result that may indicate protein–protein interactions and/or looping events in these peaks
