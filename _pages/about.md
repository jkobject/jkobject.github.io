## About this website

<!-- A longer presentation of what People will find in this website -->

This website was made with Jekyll and minimal-mistake's layout. You can see it in [my github](https://www.github.com/jkobject/jkobject.github.io)
The goal of using this framework is to allow me to maintain a website, a blog, and a portfolio without using third-party closed-source code.
I have migrated my medium articles super easily using `mediumexporter` command.

The goal of the website is 3-fold:

- be an open door to my professional activity.
- share my opinions and ideas and allow debates to happen here, thanks to Disqus.
- gather some personal information related to lifestyle: sharing music, books, movies, science readings, etc.

Feel free to reuse everything not related to content on this website.
