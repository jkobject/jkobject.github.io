This is a big story, and it seems that everything before led me to this point. I have decided to join [Laura Cantini]() at Institut Pasteur and [Gabriel Peyr√©]() at ENS ULM for a joint Ph.D. in Computational Biology and Applied Mathematics. I will try to explain here my decision process for something that can appear as a very sudden change of direction and slightly crazy, given my current position at WhitelabGx.

You can learn more about what I did at WhitelabGx
work at broad / DFCI

work on celligner2 and envisioning foundational models

Tough recruitements at DeepMind / Owkin / BenevolentAI

Atlas at whitelab, single cell, cellxgene and the rise of foundational models

Companies in comp bio - the good the bad and the ugly - open source projects and creating values

very hard decisions. doing the hard thing. doing the right thing
