Last time, I was in my kitchen, looking at my google home and the 3 lights + thermostat it was able to control. I felt quite underwhelmed with the effort I had to go through to find and install these. Amongst the many objects in my home, there is still a few, mostly expansive objects that I could call "smart". 10 years after the beginning of the smaart things revolution. 60 years after the first ideas of the smart home. Why so little progress? Why is it so expansive? why do I always need yet another app, yet another complex IFTTT API to just be able to turn off my light bulb from my phone?


## The obvious reasons

big players
fragmentation
appliance companies don't make phones
need to disrupt the market every time

## The solutions

open source technologies
big market players getting in the way (ikea)
another solution. a compay that only does that


## The company

sells smart things
