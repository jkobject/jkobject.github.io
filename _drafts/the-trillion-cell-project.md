### 1 trillion cell project v1

_see  1 trillion cell project first_

we deeply sequence an ipsc at different time points while having it transition into an organoid.
we then try to model, using learnt from spatial sc transcriptome profile, a cellular automata to get the same phenotypic behavior.

### 1 trillion cell project

sequence for : 1000 humans at  100,000 different time point in their development.
-> 10,000,000 different datapoints.
the state of all their different cell types in different parts of their body.
I would say at least a 100,000,000 cells. and RNAseq these cells (and protein seq as well?).
at 20,000 reads per cells.
(so gather: 2,000,000,000,000,000,000 reads, 100,000,000,000,000 transcriptomes)
a 4000Pb matrix, 10Pb of data. 

and learn to approximate it with a cellular automata. Once that can be done and the mapping state-transcription has been learnt. you can find the equilibrium states and how to nudge the transcriptome to get back at equilibrium. Thus alleviating aging and aging relate diseases.
