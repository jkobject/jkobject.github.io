## on using ML at the broad. 

I kinda feel that the sheer amount of data at the broad forces the com biologist to think about using it all. So we focus on crazy inference using the entirety of the matrix only to realize that the matrix is not big enough.

Maybe a better approach is to come back to the basics by trying to think about a very local and constrained problem related to the data we have but only using a very small sample of it. like prediction of one drug from one set of sequences. Here we really do not have the data to apply learning approaches. however, we now that we can create / learn a model that has a lot of prior (including basic genetic functioning. adding chemical modeling, drug information, structure. etc..)

To arrive at the inference on this we would need to separate the inference into submodules. Some of them could leverage other datasets or modes, to learn the specific task they try to deal with (genomic interaction, protein interaction, etc...)
out of this. we have a functioning model with little inference ability.
However we still have a ton of data left. the matter is then only to scale thee model to use all the data at our disposal to improve accuracy and especially, improve results.

## Harry Potter style image: __NOW DONE__

taking a neural network like a GAN or a physical predictor to generate a 100 of images from an actual one (or two) to generate a short video.

A next version is to add emoji like object and predict people's interactions with it.

next level is predict what would be the real life version of old pictures.

## On the difference discuted with baptiste between correlation and causation

correlation is causation without simplifying assumptions

causation is what correlation becomes when you admit some things which will get your system (defining your measured/interest variables) closed or closed enough so that you can then know that if Y and X are correlated, X cannot influence Y and : X & Y are the only parameters in the system, then X cause Y

--> link to falsifiability hypothesis of doing science
--> link to quantum mechanisms and theoretical physics.

## teaching engineering vs biology reveals about what we still don't know
Imagine a world in which I am an Engineer teacher trying to comprehensively explain computer from the ground up hardware to software. How do I explain that ? 
Should I say. How eveything works thanks to the GPU. This is the non GPU things, this is a kind of GPU that give power...
Should I explain all of electronics ? Maybe I would adopt a really scaled approach ?
This would definitely give names but not too much. /!\ decribe things by what they do. skip the irrelevant parts ( battery, design) explain the screen in a way that allows them to understand the basic working and property of the screen, (irrevelvant its inner working (LED, OLED, LCD ...)  I wouldn(t need to go into details as all the details are on the WEB in a well behaved way) I would explain how to change things in the computer. how to play with a computer , how to add new programs. I would not spend time on explaining evolution of the computer architectures... now read everything and think about me teaching you system's biology

## crowd fund building creation on web platforms:

create the biggest kickstarter project: What would be very very cool, beneficial direclty to a lot of people ? a tower for the next generation. the Ultima tower for example can be build as a 3000 m tall building with a surface area of 120km^2 and host 1 million people. its cost is estimated at 150B$ but let's be realist about realistically estimated cost and multiply it by two. 
You would host 1M people. and it would take 20 years to be built from the start of the Kickstarter project. So you would need people pleding between 500 000$ and 5 million $ for different apartment styles. You only ask them to put the money somewhere and to give it to the company, by contract for each milestones achieved. 10% first then 40% when it start being built. 30% when it is half built then 20% when it is finished. it would require only 1.2M$ for a family of four to live in the biggest man made construction. and this is without counting revenues from companies, locations etc.

## A story: La planète fantastique. 

C'est une planète qui apparaîtrait presque magique à un humain de la terre. Situés sûrement en de nombreux endroits de l'univers! Elle est comme de nombreuses planète monodiurne et présente toujours la même face à son soleil. Cette planète possède donc j'en face brûlante comme mercure et pleine de lumière et une autre constamment sombre et glaciale. Heureusement. Des vents voilent permettent de diminuer cet effet en parcourant l'équateur de la planète. Le seul tellement important Équateur de cette planète est celui qui la traverse en délimitant l'ombre et la lumière, on dit que c'est la que la vue y a émergé. Et le seul endroit où elle peut de développer. Il es vrai que la vie y est luxuriante. Et que les plantes profitent d'un soleil constat. Mais ce n'est pas la que réside toute le particularité de cette planète. Oh non. En effet. La vie, cherchant toujours de nouvelles niches s'est habitué à des conditions extrême et à migre en des lieux bien inhospitalier. L'opposition radicale de chèques côté de cette planète à permis l'émergence entente tout autant divergence mais aussi symbiotiques. La face ensoleillé voit apparaître des ...

## The 3D revolution.

The 3D revolution. We live in a 3D world and we think in 3D right ? Well this certainly dont mean much. But if we look at our inventions we might start to have an answer. We communicate on flat surfaces, we interact we flat screens and keyboards. is that it ? We also create 3D things. but when we look closer we start to feel as if it is only 2D stuffs that have been mounted on top of each other. long a car. a 2D chassis, with a 2D doors and a block on top of it. look at a house, it is walls that together build your house. look at clothes.. build upon patrons of 2D surfaces of leather and wool. So we might be more 2D intelligences than 3D ones. or maybe that it is easy for us to interact with object one dimension less than the one we are embeded in. Thus imagine what a 4D beings might create with its imagination. for this we have a clue. nature do not care bout dimension. it only builds the best object given an environment. what it has built is inherently 3D. you won't see a detailed drawing of a human body's inner workings. its structure is fundamentally 3D and representing in 2 in a way for us to understand it, is impossible. 
For now everything we produce is 2dimensional, CADs and 3D printers are starting to change this (even if the concept of printing is only to layer 2D things on top of each other, it is a first step) 

What I am predicting however is that with the rise of AR, AI and advanced building tools, we might one day start the revolution of 3D design and objects. to live in a world, better designed.

what if neural networks all shared some common property considering their weights. like their sum is equal to a function of the number of neurons and connections. Following the ideas on homeostatic plasticity and brain quasicriticality https://www.quantamagazine.org/brains-may-teeter-near-their-tipping-point-20180614/ 

Look into this curiosity driven to stuff but change the definition of unknown to add a computation of reward a low entropic behavior of the input feature space

to do a neural programmer task, the problem is of differentiability between functions. (programming function are discrete) but in topology we know the we just need to define a space and a distance metric to have a metrizable topological space (maybe we don't even need it). we can derivate these functions if they are not too discontinuous (lispitz stuff)
---> definir une metrique sur n'importe quoi pour pouvoir le differentiabiliser
