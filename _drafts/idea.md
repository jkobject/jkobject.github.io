### 1 trillion cell project v1

_see  1 trillion cell project first_

we deeply sequence an ipsc at different time points while having it transition into an organoid.
we then try to model, using learnt from spatial sc transcriptome profile, a cellular automata to get the same phenotypic behavior.

### 1 trillion cell project

sequence for : 1000 humans at  100,000 different time point in their development.
-> 10,000,000 different datapoints.
the state of all their different cell types in different parts of their body.
I would say at least a 100,000,000 cells. and RNAseq these cells (and protein seq as well?).
at 20,000 reads per cells.
(so gather: 2,000,000,000,000,000,000 reads, 100,000,000,000,000 transcriptomes)
a 4000Pb matrix, 10Pb of data. 

and learn to approximate it with a cellular automata. Once that can be done and the mapping state-transcription has been learnt. you can find the equilibrium states and how to nudge the transcriptome to get back at equilibrium. Thus alleviating aging and aging relate diseases. 


### About solving the issue with today's (social or not) (media or not) (science or not) issues

This is mainly the same issues: people's and the system's ability to disentangle the truth from the wrong, the people with agenda to the true connaisseurs? How to disentangle the data backed info from the fake news, the one second stupid info to the true game changers?

It is about one system's ability to self reflect, about one system's ability to pick knowledgeable people from non knowlegeable people and to curate the true information.

This is exactly what is not happening in today's "broad" communication platforms. 

1. the true information is shared by knowledgeable people on that topic.
2. knowledgeable people on topic often form a community over that topic.
3. topics can change with time (created; changed)
4. knowledgeable people can change with time (long) (not be anymore as the topic has changed).
5. the set of all topics are an evolving hierarchical knowledge graph. very much like google's knowledge graph.
6. what makes something true in the end is the direct or indirect (secondary/tertiary) impact it has had on many other topics, including its own.

7. reproducibility:grouping stuff.
8. a topic is defined by its community
9. someone is considered knowledgeable if he has made many contributions to a topic (liked true infos), shared many impactfull informations true ones.
10. an impactfull information is something that is shared by 


### on using ML at the broad. 

I kinda feel that the sheer amount of data at the broad forces the com biologist to think about using it all. So we focus on crazy inference using the entirety of the matrix only to realize that the matrix is not big enough.

Maybe a better approach is to come back to the basics by trying to think about a very local and constrained problem related to the data we have but only using a very small sample of it. like prediction of one drug from one set of sequences. Here we really do not have the data to apply learning approaches. however, we now that we can create / learn a model that has a lot of prior (including basic genetic functioning. adding chemical modeling, drug information, structure. etc..)

To arrive at the inference on this we would need to separate the inference into submodules. Some of them could leverage other datasets or modes, to learn the specific task they try to deal with (genomic interaction, protein interaction, etc...)
out of this. we have a functioning model with little inference ability.
However we still have a ton of data left. the matter is then only to scale thee model to use all the data at our disposal to improve accuracy and especially, improve results. 





### the cell program





### what a research Paper Reader should have;

- should read both md, ipython, pdf, txt, latex, html, websites, videos (youtube or others), files directly*
- should be linked with a paper manager similar to zotero but simpler and with more management of your papers* instead of just citations
- it should allow linking to all platform providing papers
- should be linked to researcher's blogs, databases, groups
- All the basic edition options from aperçu
- should have all citations and remarks etc.. as hyperlinks
- should contain a table of content on the side
- citations on a box on the side
- figures and additionals always retrieved and on the side
- meta data on the side and not in the paper
SHOULD BE A WEBPAGE
- with interaction to twitter feeds, commentary, readers, etc...
- should remmeber where you are at, how much of it you read.
- many personalisation options to define yourself stuffs
- link with reasearch profiles and with personal reading scores etc.. 
- apps for tablets, phones and eInk readers.
- know how much you read and where you are at by looking at your eyes.
- 




### Harry Potter style image: 

taking a neural network like a GAN or a physical predictor to generate a 100 of images from an actual one (or two) to generate a short video.

A next version is to add emoji like object and predict people's interactions with it. 

next level is predict what would be the real life version of old pictures.

## On the difference discuted with baptiste between correlation and causation

correlation is causation without simplifying assumptions

causation is what correlation becomes when you admit some things which will get your system (defining your measured/interest variables) closed or closed enough so that you can then know that if Y and X are correlated, X cannot influence Y and : X & Y are the only parameters in the system, then X cause Y

--> link to falsifiability hypothesis of doing science
--> link to quantum mechanisms and theoretical physics.

ok so 1000 M ha for food prod, of which 72% for crops
33% of total land for crops as well.
what happen if we forbid live stock food and make everything hydroponic.
there is 2 million towns
if food is hydroponic and we are able to make cereals grow hydroponically there is 80% of the food that can be grown that way.
so 800 M ha which represent 8M sq km we can grow up to 30% better with that can of agriculture so 5M sq km, also 3 times as fast so 1.5Msq km. we can also grow on levels with 2m for crops and 0.5 for the 8% rest so given a building of 100M we have 10m where we put 20 times the 8% and 90M where we put 45times the rest so 7000sq km for other and 20k sq km for the res so 27k sq km. we can then build a 100x250km building for 80% of the crops. we would not need more to feed the entire population 
but we expect a doubling of the population so we would need 2 times more space and let's account for 20% desctruction for unfortunate events so 250 sq km would be needed to feed well the entire world population. if we do not account for ressources need (water and electricity and minerals) else we would need approx 300Mwh/y for a sq meter so 300TwH  for a sq km so 75Pwh/an une centrale nucleaire peut produire 10Twh/ans so we would need 750 nuclear facilities (let's add 250 for other production requirements) which would consome 100kg of uranium/day or 40T/year. almost 2/3 of global production.

Look into this curiosity driven to stuff but change the definition of unknown to add a computation of reward a low entropic behavior of the input feature space

to do a neural programmer task, the problem is of differentiability between functions. (programming function are discrete) but in topology we know the we just need to define a space and a distance metric to have a metrizable topological space (maybe we don't even need it). we can derivate these functions if they are not too discontinuous (lispitz stuff)
---> definir une metrique sur n'importe quoi pour pouvoir le differentiabiliser

Imagine a world in which I am an Engineer teacher trying to comprehensively explain computer from the ground up hardware to software. How do I explain that ? 
Should I say. How eveything works thanks to the GPU. This is the non GPU things, this is a kind of GPU that give power...
Should I explain all of electronics ? Maybe I would adopt a really scaled approach ?
This would definitely give names but not too much. /!\ decribe things by what they do. skip the irrelevant parts ( battery, design) explain the screen in a way that allows them to understand the basic working and property of the screen, (irrevelvant its inner working (LED, OLED, LCD ...)  I wouldn(t need to go into details as all the details are on the WEB in a well behaved way) I would explain how to change things in the computer. how to play with a computer , how to add new programs. I would not spend time on explaining evolution of the computer architectures... now read everything and think about me teaching you system's biology

WHY BMI sucks
your body is your BMI if it is limited, improve it but don't try to plug things in places that are not meant for it. the entire design of the brain is to communicate through your body. putting wires inside won't help.
I am not against wires inside for brain diagnosis, repair or other. like a computer. if you want to improve the power of you computer you can add external memory, more ram... but you will not add more screens by plugging it directly to your CPU, you need to go throught ready made interfaces to your CPU through your mother board. same for the brain and the human body. you can have more interfaces than your body, though your nerves.. but you won't plug it directly into your brain for f* sake

create the biggest kickstarter project: What would be very very cool, beneficial direclty to a lot of people ? a tower for the next generation. the Ultima tower for example can be build as a 3000 m tall building with a surface area of 120km^2 and host 1 million people. its cost is estimated at 150B$ but let's be realist about realistically estimated cost and multiply it by two. 
You would host 1M people. and it would take 20 years to be built from the start of the Kickstarter project. So you would need people pleding between 500 000$ and 5 million $ for different apartment styles. You only ask them to put the money somewhere and to give it to the company, by contract for each milestones achieved. 10% first then 40% when it start being built. 30% when it is half built then 20% when it is finished. it would require only 1.2M$ for a family of four to live in the biggest man made construction. and this is without counting revenues from companies, locations etc.

How to symbolise a virtual world in which every human being would live ? why it would not be like being traped in chrome.

*Listening to blade runner.*

That is what it looks like. from where you stand, look to the outside world from your window, where you stand it is warmer and noisier than outside. you have access to food, information, shelter and people from inside. We have a tendency to think that inside would be inside a building, inside your home or a cafe. But in a virtual world, inside would more or less mean the same thing, but inside would also mean being outside... of the real world.. Your window would be infinite, an infinity of streams from the real world, you could go from every window and every places in an instant. Going out of the window would mean going into the real world. in a body shaped to your desire. it would feel great and peacefull since the real world would be the only thing left that is not instantaneously shaped to ones' desire... just kidding. everything would be shaped to man's desire. Inside or outside it is the same. you want something it appears. wether it is from a virtual construct or from a real world  entirely shaped by cell like nanobots that inprint man's desire to its surroundings. 
Would it be better ? Would you be you ?  I don't know do you want it to ? In a world where your desires are reality you can do whatever you want. And you would most certainly choose for it to be better and for you ... not to be you like you used to be. O

La planète fantastique.

Cette planète possède donc j'en face brûlante comme mercure et pleine de lumière et une autre constamment sombre et glaciale. Heureusement. Des vents voilent permettent de diminuer cet effet en parcourant l'équateur de la planète. Le seul tellement important Équateur de cette planète est celui qui la traverse en délimitant l'ombre et la lumière, on dit que c'est la que la vue y a émergé. Et le seul endroit où elle peut de développer. Il es vrai que la vie y est luxuriante. Et que les plantes profitent d'un soleil constat. Mais ce n'est pas la que réside toute le particularité de cette planète. Oh non. En effet. La vie, cherchant toujours de nouvelles niches s'est habitué à des conditions extrême et à migre en des lieux bien inhospitalier. L'opposition radicale de chèques côté de cette planète à permis l'émergence entente tout autant divergence mais aussi symbiotiques. La face ensoleillé voit apparaître des ...

The 3D revolution. We live in a 3D world and we think in 3D right ? Well this certainly dont mean much. But if we look at our inventions we might start to have an answer. We communicate on flat surfaces, we interact we flat screens and keyboards. is that it ? We also create 3D things. but when we look closer we start to feel as if it is only 2D stuffs that have been mounted on top of each other. long a car. a 2D chassis, with a 2D doors and a block on top of it. look at a house, it is walls that together build your house. look at clothes.. build upon patrons of 2D surfaces of leather and wool. So we might be more 2D intelligences than 3D ones. or maybe that it is easy for us to interact with object one dimension less than the one we are embeded in. Thus imagine what a 4D beings might create with its imagination. for this we have a clue. nature do not care bout dimension. it only builds the best object given an environment. what it has built is inherently 3D. you won't see a detailed drawing of a human body's inner workings. its structure is fundamentally 3D and representing in 2 in a way for us to understand it, is impossible. 
For now everything we produce is 2dimensional, CADs and 3D printers are starting to change this (even if the concept of printing is only to layer 2D things on top of each other, it is a first step) 

What I am predicting however is that with the rise of AR, AI and advanced building tools, we might one day start the revolution of 3D design and objects. to live in a world, better designed.
