Recently I had fun making a short chalkboard computation. unregarding any related challenges, what would be the foot print of a factory producing the world's food supply?

Ok, so the world is using 1B ha for food production in 2015 [1], of which 72% is actually for crops. ad an astonishing number: 33% of total habitable land is for crops as well. Dreaming of a "brave new world". I tthen set out to decide that we shall stop using animals for food cosumption. Argument is easy to make (pollution, suffering, energy waste & land use)... and this is my computation after all.

## The idea

So, what happens if we forbid live stock food productio, and make everything hydroponic?
Forbinding crops we actually now need much less food use, so say $$600M ha$$. This represents actually $$6M km^2$$. A cautious estimate would say that we can grow this food at least 30% more efficiently (space wise), than for regular agriculture. Being freed from any form of weather issues, we can make much faster growing crops. Let's be cautious and only say 2 times faster. We are then now "only" using $$2,100,000 km^2$$ land for this. Now let's be crazy, for reasons I will discuss later, the crops (hwatever its type) might not exceed 1.5m in height. And this factory will be 100m high. so that is at least 50 floors, since you need to acccount for some space for any machines, drains, etc. So now your footprint is "only" $$42,000 km^2$$!

But this is not all. A lot of crops are (and can) be much smaller in size than 1.5m a better management of space usage might reduce it to -let's be cautious- a further 30%. $$30,000km^2$$.
We can then build a 0.1x100x300km building. We would not need more to feed the entire population. but we expect a doubling of the population so we would need 2 times more space in 2100.

![building space]()

This is of ccourse a very rough estimates and I would guess that it could vary between hal to twice the size I just gave. I also missed a lot of complexity. What about supply and ressources you'll tell me. How much water, electricity and minerals would you need? That would be hell of a footprint as well.

Say we would need approximatelly 90GW of energy. an LED is 70% efficient. only 2% of sun's light is used by plants. the sun radiates arrable land at an average over the year of 20Wh/m^2. So our plant would need to use 2W/m^2 in our plant of lighting energy. this would mean 2MW/km^2. so let's say our plan would consume 60GW of energy and let's add 50% for transport, movement, temperature control etc..

A nuclear facility can output on 1.5GW of energy. So we would need 60 nuclear power plants to power this world's food supply, that is approximatelly 50% than France's production of electricity from power plants. clearly doable and with a footprint too low to count. Now with that amouunt of nuclear power and plants (no pun intended), we reeeaally need water.. around 270 B liters / day for the power plants. 

But building them near the shores or river beds and its done. For an example we builr our factory right in the middle of France. Sorry and goodbye to all those beauttiful burgundy villages.. But at least we have the requirements needed to build our factory.

## The promises

Now what about the crops you say. Well this is where it becomes intersting. For hydropony we only need 10 times less water than for regular agriculture. But if one was able to mange perfectly the recycling and recirculation of water, you would need hundreds of times less water and, similarly, almost no nutrients get wasted in that case we woul actually be decreasing our water consumption by factor of 3, get rid of pesticide, chemicals, and almost anihilate our environmental footprint on the planet.

Obviously making 1 factory somewhere is extremelly stupid. It helped to visualize impacts, but you would want to have many 100s around the planet, each producing all produce so that nothig has to travel more than a few 100 miles to get to one's plate.

You have seen the promises of such a change in our consumption and production of food. Human population could grow a hundred fold, and it would still not be too much of an issue.

But I wanted to illustrate the environmental promise a bit more and ask you to imagine every arable land in the world, being given back to nature. Transformed into gigantic reserves filled with animals, forests and swamps. gigantic parks where people can get lost as if they were the only humans on the planet.

## why it needs to happen

Today many issues are facing us related to food. Global warming is caused in huge part due to our consumption of food, from crops production, to cattles farm, transportation and its resulting waste. a global usage of hydropony systems would prevent pollution from transport, enable much less energy consumption for production and so doind decrease waste with tighter stock managements.

Global warming consequences. food security


soil artificialisation annd descruction

pressure on wildlife

obesity and under nutrition

feeding the 10 billions humans


## what is standing in the way

first investment

## how do we solve it 
using genomics.

## how to build a business out of it.

How to make it cheaper and better than regular produce?
Fancy products
ungrowable products.
quality. location. time. scale.
