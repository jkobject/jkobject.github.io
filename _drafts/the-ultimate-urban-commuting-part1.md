What if during the coming decades we could see teleportation and pain-free travel becoming somewhat of a reality?

Today, transportation of goods, of people has never been so easy. We can go around the world in a day, spend a one week holiday in another continent and no one really needs to walk anymore.

With Mondialization, this trend is increasing. It is increasing the number of goods and people. Against what may headlines are showing, I do not believe that mondialization is dying. transport is a trend that has been increasing since the dawn of humanity and unless a civilization stall or collapse, it will not stop. Well.. let me stop here right now, I will not enter into a debate around mondialisation today. Let's just agree for this one short essay that we see it as a net gain for civilization, leading to culture increase, widening of human possibilities and of abilities in arts, sport and sciences. Let's just accept that this is the best mean humanity has to achieve global peace and equality for all.

Let's also agree on the issues we face, cost of long distance transportation is still prohibitive for many humans, cars are unsafe and kill millions every year.

Many current modes of travelling create environmental problems: from airplaine and car noise, to air pollution from tires and unefficient gas burning to large roads destroying everyone's living spaces.

It also consumes energy... and unfortunately, most of today's energy participates to global warming.

## scaling

Now that we agree that all things being equal, transportation of goods and people is good and we want more of it.

But: scaling will / can lower costs a lost.

and continue to do so. but need a shift in usage a shift that started with light mobility in the commute (last miles) and need to sweep through the rest of our transport economy.

We will start with that and explore how it is changing our life and then dream a little.

## small commute as 

Soon 80% of the planet will live in cities. They get larger and more congestionated 

car is not the solution link

what we would want is something that feels like having wheels in your shoes. is it exactly that we want? not sure. but multiple new ways: eboard, solowheel, bikes, etc.. But we need more, multitype things for different people and different needs, storage bikes, old people chairs, etc..

this is why first this needs to be on demand. 

But what if


## you don't think about it. --> auto-planification with AI

cross state multi modal automated system.

## self driving + action-based vehicles as teleportation.

teleportation is making you travel when you don't think about it. with good enough planning/predicition.

when you solo work, sleep, read, eat, watch videos, play video games, chat.

with good enough systems the majority of your life is amenable to travel given good prediction and automated systems.
company advantages and price.

## long distance travel. 

why plane are likely not the solution :
  - energy: friction  = v**2
  - going up (gravity)
    - gravity could actually be your friend (link)
  - security
  - management

hyperloop (link)
- cost decreaase if we all use the same system
  - plane is super cheap, no rail to install, but install rail between A-B B-C C-D so in the end can do A-D by rail but too long and have to change rail 
  - if super fast and no need to change rail (small size cabin & standards), its good.

digitalisation / automation of border crossing
