During the summer of 2022, I was feeling pretty desperate. I had just spent 6 months over many failed attempts at securing positions at high-profile companies like Deepmind, BenevolentAI, Isomorphic Labs, and Owkin. I had gone through very long and tedious interview processes where for some, it had felt like I was mainly just missing a Ph.D. . Some other times it felt like bad luck. Or not taking enough time outside work to review concepts.

But at the end of July, everything went very fast. I had gone through a couple of interviews at a young promising French startup called Aqemia and was quickly hired as a Research Scientist to start their target discovery team.

The pay was low and I negotiated together with stock options and a relocation bonus. I accepted it and 2 months later I was in Paris.

I will now try to present the 2 months I spent at Aqemia:

## Disclaimer:

Why am I doing that?

It is simple: I strongly believe in openness and honesty and I think the world is a better place every time someone speaks freely and openly about subject matters that have been kept behind closed doors.

I am talking here about my sole experience at Aqemia. With the management of 2022. This is just one point of view at one specific moment in time. I also have my own values and reference frame. Please do not use anyone's experience to judge a current company on this account and do your due diligence.

Because of the nature of the subject and respect for anyone currently working at Aqemia, I will keep this post private for now. If you are interested in reading it, please shout out an email and I will send it to you.

But I might at least let you know about what Aqemia was very open about as of the end of 2022:

- Aqemia is a very fast environment.
- Most people (more than half) are leaving the company after a few months. (It is not clear if this is because of Aqemia's decisions or because of their own choices).
- This percentage is higher for people with previous experience in industry and biotech. Aqemia is largely composed of young graduates.
- Aqemia is mostly composed of people coming from a small set of elite French engineering schools. They have however little knowledge in research and biology.

## The first 3 weeks

In most companies, the first 3 weeks are a time to get used to the new environment. You are not expected to be super productive. You are expected to learn and to get to know your colleagues.

Arriving at Aqemia I realized that it was composed of mostly young graduates in data science, some young engineer, and Ph.D. graduates in chemistry. I entered a team of 3 people. It seems their goal was to maintain and improve the target discovery pipeline. I was not leading the team but had a manager that had arrived less than a year ago. He was coming from a car-sharing startup called Blablacar. He had some experience in data science and engineering but none in anything related to Aqemia.

I was given an introductory project with the new people arriving at Aqemia. It was a project to run the target discovery pipeline on one specific target. And check if the pipeline made sense.

The way it works is really by taking any proteins with sufficient experimental data and checking if we can produce reliable predictions for them.

So not finding new targets. just finding proteins on which we can work.

The full pipeline outputs results for all proteins with sufficient data. Then comes the manual work to find a disease for this target, find a good chemical for it, and optimize it to improve it in-silico.

I was told to focus on this exercise by my mentor and finish it "quickly", however, it was a 3-week long program with checkpoints and meetings.

I think he did not know what to give me as a project initially. I was not sure also why I was not leading the team and why I was not given the possibility to start working on what I had assumed was my project: automatize the target-disease association.

So I started working on that on my own. I wanted to gather people around this objective and understand the need of everyone and their opinion on this part of the analysis. I went designing presentations and having meetings with most key people in the company.

However, I felt some unease coming from some people and even could see one of my team members: a young recruit coming from engineering school, be angry at me and this goal during my meeting: "I don't understand why you are working on this" she told me once, "I don't want us to meet to talk about this project".

During the second week, I was asked if I had the time, to work on some other project related to the "hit discovery pipeline". It was inefficient and they wanted to improve it. I was happy to help and started working on it on the side as well. At the end of the week as my mentor was not on site our meeting was replaced by one with the CTO. She wanted me to present what I did, especially the "hit discovery part". I had a couple of ideas and tested some of them but had still trouble accessing the data and understanding the pipeline. It was very hard receiving help from the person in charge (the same that had given me the "I don't want us to meet to talk about this project" before). She said it was ok but I should focus more on the project and work on my presentation skills more.

## the next 2 weeks:

After a month, I ended up in a strange meeting with my boss. He seemed uneasy as well. He told me that he did not have anything problematic to tell me personally and he could not judge my work given his lack of knowledge in the field. However, he had received negative feedback about me. He told me that these are things that happen often and I should see it as a challenge. Also, I should consider the idea that I might not be a good fit for the company.

A few thoughts came to my mind and I expressed the desire to:

1. I wanted to know asap what were the negative feedbacks
2. understand why things were already going that bad
3. understand why I was not leading the team/project I was told during my recruitment.

I also expressed worriedness at the idea that I might not be a good fit for the company. I had already left a very good position at Broad and the prospect and ending up without a job and back in France was daunting.

The answers were elusive. Here they were:

1. The issues were: "My interaction with some people". "My presentation skill". "The effort I had put into the side project of the hit discovery pipeline".
2. "This is Aqemia. This how it is... and even for me it is very tough to work here"
3. "I understand and I am sorry about this situation"

He told me that he still stands behind everything that others said even if it was not something he was able to see by himself. He also told me that I should see it as a challenge and now I should focus mostly on the "hit discovery pipeline" project as it had become urgent.

## The following month:

"I do like a challenge," I told myself and I had not been impressed by most people's skill in any particular topic. I thought that if they hadn't seen my worth, I should be able to show it to them.

I was now mostly working on something else than the main project I had. This small project was simple in appearance but actually hard to find any good solution for improvement without changing the underlying code. Fortunately, I found an idea and ran with it.

On the side, I decided to inquire with friends in the company and people on my team about behavior, etc...

Here is what I found out:

1. asking questions all around about the pipeline and target discovery was not seen well by some: "Who does he think he is" some thought. Many did not understand or accept that I was tasked with the target discovery pipeline. Many did not even know what that was.
2. I understood that mostly 2 people had an issue with me:
   1. The member of my team did not want to talk with me about the pipeline. I later realized that she was thinking of leading this project herself despite her lack of knowledge or experience and that she was seeing me as a threat.
   2. The CTO of the company. I later understood that she was not sure about my profile before I was hired and did not think that the target discovery pipeline was something they ought to work on right now. My hiring was actually mostly a decision of the CEO. I also understood that his opinion is never really questioned at Aqemia and that doing so is risky and often pointless.
3. I understood that actually most senior-level people have left or are often leaving the company pretty early on. The greatest exception might have been regarding computational chemists. Although they were not immune to it. They contained the most experienced people in the company. They were also the most respected and the most listened to.
4. It was seen badly for someone to leave the company early (before 7 pm) or arrive late (after 9 pm). It is something that was not used to at all from previous work experience. I then decided that I would now be on-site as long as I could.

Realizing that I was troubled by what would be my future in such a company. But being an optimist, I thought that this was something I might be able to change. "We are not that big and everything is changing so fast," I thought.

So I spent the next month working hard. I was on site on average 10-11 hours a day and finished quickly an update to the pipeline that was improving the speed by 70%. allowing us to test 3 times more targets than before.

I also tried to be as nice as possible to the problematic team member, as unthreatening as possible. And had all my presentations reviewed by at least two people before showing them?

I was told by my boss that everything was really good for him. And he gave me another project, now with the ML team. I was tasked to uncover issues in the ML drug prediction pipeline.

This one went also quite well, we uncovered many bugs and I was spearheading a lot of the efforts on this front. We also had great feedback from the CTO on it.

## getting worse

Despite the many structural issues I had listed above, I was then quite optimistic about the next review meeting.

However, my mentor gave me nothing less than a very cold shower. Despite everything I had been told. I had done this, the feedback had stayed exactly the same. If not worse.
He told me he did not know what to do really and that is how Aqemia can be.
I still had 2 more weeks to show my worth but not much more. It was brief, I was completely distraught. I had never felt that bad in years. When I asked for the reasons, he said that it was the same issue as before. "I might not be a good fit"

I spent the next 2 weeks working hard but also preparing for a meeting with the CTO, now knowing that she was behind most of it. I had to reason with her. However, she refused to meet with me. She told me "I don't have time. Talk to your mentor, he will talk to me".

## Realizing the ugly truth

In the last 2 weeks, I started to realize I was fighting against the wind. Everything clicked in my head. It was not really about what I was doing and "I" was not the main character in this story: It was also a fight between the CEO and the CTO. It was about my boss trying to keep his seat and being afraid. It was that problematic colleague trying to have my position. There was nothing I could do now. Talking with a few friends that knew aqemia well, the main advice was: "Do like the others and leave. You will feel much better"; "Don't try to fight"

> Am I in a Biotech version of a Boston Consulting Group like a French company filled with internal fights, hidden allegiances, and faked behaviors?

What should I do now? I asked myself. I had left a very good position at Broad and the prospect and ending up without a job and back in France was daunting.

I thought I would stay, try to make my case and in the meantime, look for other positions. As I am writing all this, it seems obvious that leaving the company asap was the best choice. But in hindsight, things are always clearer.

## Reverse culture shock

Going back over this, it was hard to separate what I was living professionally from my personal life and move back to France. Even if on the personal side, everything was great. I couldn't stop from generalizing it, I felt that moving had been a terrible mistake, that France really did not want me back, and that it was treating extremely poorly people that wanted to come back.

Some of it was France itself for sure: In France, the first 4 months are like a very long interview process, called a trial period. French companies and startups, even more, cannot fire you, ever, after this period. So that leads to behaviors as one sees at Aqemia.

In France, Grandes Ecole is a microcosm where people that went to schools A & B know each other and recognize each other. They deserve the best and they are the best. That leads to some arrogance but also very competitive behaviors, these schools do not teach teamwork, they teach competition.

But there was also obviously a cultural layer in the company that was explaining a lot of it too. The competition, internal fights, and lack of trust. the "we are the best and smartest..." attitude. the "one way of doing things, my way".

## Leaving Aqemia

In hindsight again, I should have expected what was to come: after 3.5 months at Aqemia, I had a meeting with my boss. I knew he would continue my trial period and this is actually what I wanted. He come and told me he was in shock as well but he had been asked to tell me that continuing the trial period would not even be a good idea. Again when asked why, he could only give answers like: "This is how Aqemia is. We don't want to waste your time. It doesn't come from me at all. I don't really understand either. I am sorry. Sometimes I think of leaving the company when I see things like this...".

Knowing that he would be here today I then requested a meeting with the CEO. He said that we had not spoken a lot after my arrival. That he was sorry about this decision and he wasn't sure it was a sensible decision. However, Aqemia's policy is: "In doubt of someone, then there is no doubt."

There and then I was really in awe. After this decision on them, after my mentor's behavior, discussion with people, and the way I felt. After hearing such idiocy: "In doubt, no doubt?". -> WTF is this place was now all I could think of.

I had initially planned of giving him my version of the story. Explaining what I thought was happening and why it was nonsense, but I did not.

"We can still wait a few more weeks if you want", the CEO said.

I had realized the only thing I wanted was to leave this hellish situation and this place that had, in only a few weeks became hell for me.

"I am going to leave now," I said.
"Now, now?" he asked.
"Yes, now. I am going to pack my things and leave now"
"Sure you don't want to wait a few more weeks, at least to outboard what you did?"
"Nope"
...

So ended the Aqemia story for me. And, from what I could hear from many friends and colleagues that were at Aqemia or arrived after me, this is how it went for quite a lot of pretty brilliant people.
