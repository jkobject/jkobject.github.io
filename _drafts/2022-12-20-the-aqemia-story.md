During the summer of 2022, I was feeling pretty desesperated. I had just spent 6 months over many failed attempts at securing positions at high profile companies like Deepmind, BenevolentAI, Isomorphic Labs and Owkin. I had went through very long and tedious interview processes where for some, it had felt like I was mainly just missing a Ph.D. . Some other time it felt like bad luck. Or not taking enough time outside work to review concepts.

But during the end of July, everything went very fast. I had gone through a couple of interviews at a young promising french startup called Aqemia and was quickly hired as a Research Scientist to start their target discovery team.

The pay was low and I negociated together with stock options and a relocation bonus. I accepted it and 2 months later I was in Paris.

I will now try to present the 2 months I spent at Aqemia:

## Disclaimer:

Why am I doing that?

It is simple: I strongly believe in openness and honesty and I think the world is a better place everytime someone speaks freely and openly about subject matters that have been kept behind closed doors.

I am talking here about my sole experience at Aqemia. With the management of 2022. This is just one point of view at one specific moment in time. I also have my own values and reference frame. Please do not use any one's past experience to judge a current company on this account and do your own due diligence.

Because of the nature of the subject and by respect for any one currently working at Aqemia, I will keep this post private for now. If you are interested in reading it, please shout out an email and I will send it to you.

But I might at least let you know about what Aqemia was very open about as of end of 2022:

- Aqemia is a very fast environment.
- Most people (more than half) are leaving the company after a few months. (It is not clear if this is because of Aqemia's decisions or because of their own personal choices).
- This percentage is higher for people with previous experience in industry and biotech. Aqemia is largely composed of young graduates.
- Aqemia is mostly composed of people coming from a small set of elite french engineering school. They have however little knowledge in research and biology.

## The first 3 weeks

In most companies, the first 3 weeks are really a time to get used to the new environment. You are not expected to be super productive. You are expected to learn and to get to know your colleagues.

Arriving at Aqemia I realized that it was composed of mostly young graduates in data science, some young engineer, and Ph.D. graduates in chemistry. I entered a team of 3 people. It seems their goal was to maintain and improve the target discovery pipeline. I was not leading the team but had a manager that had arrived less than a year ago. He was coming from a car sharing startup called blablacar. He had some experience in datascience and engineering but none in anything related to Aqemia.

I was given an introductory project with the new people arriving at Aqemia. It was a project to run the target discovery pipeline on one specific target. And checking if the pipeline made sense.

The way it works is really by taking any proteins with sufficient experimental data and checking if we can produce reliable predictions for them.

So not really finding new targets. just finding proteins on which we can work.

The full pipeline outputs results for all proteins with sufficient data. Then comes the manual work to find a disease for this target, find a good chemical for it, optimise it to improve it in silico.

I was told to focus on this exercise by my mentor and finish it "quickly", However it was an exactly 3 week long program with checkpoints and meetings.

I think he did not knew what to give me as a project initially. I was not sure also why I was not leading the team and why I was not given the possibility to start working on what I had assumed was my own project: automatise the target-disease association.

So I started working on that on my own. I wanted to gather people around this objective and understand the need of everyone and their opinion on this part of the analysis. I went designing presentations and having meetings with most key people in the company.

However, I felt some unease coming from some people and even could even see one of my team member: a young recruit coming from engineering school, be angry at me and this goal during my meeting: "I don't understand why you are working on this" she told me once, "I don't want us to meet to talk about this project".

During the second week I was asked if I had the time, to work on some other project related to the "hit discovery pipeline". It was inefficient and they wanted to improve it. I was happy to help and started working on it on the side as well. At the end of the week as my mentor was not on site our meeting was replaced by one with the CTO. She wanted me to present what I did, especially the "hit discovery part". I had a couple ideas and tested some of them but had still trouble accessing the data and understanding the pipeline. It was very hard receiving help from the person in charge (the same that had given me the "I don't want us to meet to talk about this project" before). She said it was ok but I should focus more on the project and work on my presentation skills more.

## the next 2 weeks:

After a month, I ended up in a strange meeting with my boss. He seemed uneasy as well. He told me that he did not have anything problematic to tell me personally and he could not judge my work given his lack of knowledge in the field. However he had received negative feedback about me. He told me that these are things that happen often and I should see it as a challenge. Also I should consider the idea that I might not be a good fit for the company.

A few thought came to my mind and I expressed the desire to:

1. I wanted to know asap what were the negative feedbacks
2. understand why things were already going that bad
3. understand why I was not leading the team / project I was told during my recruitment.

I also expressed worryness on the idea that I might not be a good fit for the company. I had already left a very good position at Broad and the prospect and ending up without a job and back in France was daunting.

The answers were elusive. Here they were:

1. The issues were: "My interaction with some people". "My presentation skill". "The effort I had put into the side project of the hit discovery pipeline".
2. "This is Aqemia. This how it is... and even for me it is very tough to work here"
3. "I understand and I am sorry about this situation"

He told me that he still stands behind everything that other said even if it was not something he was able to see by himself. He also told me that I should see it as a challenge and now I should focus mostly on the "hit discovery pipeline" project as it had become urgent.

## the following month:

"I do like a challenge" I told myself and I had not been impressed by most people's skill in any particular topic. I thought that if they hadn't seen my worth, I should be able to show it to them.

I was now mostly working on something else than the main project I had. This small project was simple in appearance but actually hard to find any good solution on improvement without changing the underlying code. Fortunately I found an idea and ran with it.

On the side I decided to inquire with friends in the company and people in my team about behavior, etc...

Here is what I found out:

1. asking question all around about the pipeline and target discovery was not seen well by some: "who does he think he his" some apparently thought. Many did not understood or accept that I was tasked with the target discovery pipeline. Many did not even knew what that was.
2. I understood that mostly 2 people had an issue with me:
   1. The member of my team that did not wanted to talk with me about the pipeline. I later realized that she was thinking of leading this project herself despite her lack of knowledge or experience and that she was seeing me as a threat.
   2. The CTO of the company. I later understood that she was not sure about my profile before I was hired and did not thought that the target discovery pipeline was something they ought to work on right now. My hiring was actually mostly a decision of the CEO. I also understood that his opinion is never really questioned at Aqemia and that doing so is risky and often pointless.
3. I understood that actually most senior level people have left or are often leaving the company pretty early on. The greatest exception might have been regarding computational chemists. Although they were not immune to it. They contained the most experienced people in the company. They were also the most respected and the most listened to.
4. It was seen badly for someone to leave the company early (before 7pm) or arrive late (after 9pm). It is something that was not used to at all from previous work experience. I then decided that I would now be on site as long as I could.

Realizing that I was troubled by what would be my future in such a company. But being an optimist, I thought that this is something I might be able to change. "We are not that big and everything is changing so fast" I thought.

So I spent the next month working hard. I was on site on average 10-11 hours a day and finished quickly an update to the pipeline that was improving the speed by 70%. allowing us to test 3 times more targets than before.

I also tried to be as nice as possible to the problematic team member, as unthreating as possible. And had all my presentation reviewed by at least two people before showing them.

I was told by my boss that everything was really good for him. And he gave me another project, now with the ML team. I was tasked to uncover issues in the ML drug predictions pipeline.

This one went also quite well, we uncovered many bugs and I was spearheading a lot of the efforts on this front. We also had great feedbacks from the CTO on it.

## getting worse

Despite many structural issues I had listed above, I was then quite optimistic for the next review meeting.

However, my mentor gave me nothing less than a very cold shower. Despite everything I had been told. I had done, the feedback had stayed exactly the same. If not worse.
He told me he did not knew what to do really and that is how Aqemia can be.
I still had 2 more weeks to show my worth but not much more. It was brief, I was completely distraught. I had never felt that bad in years.When I asked for the reasons, he said that it was the same issues as before. "I might not be a good fit"

I spent the next 2 weeks working hard but also preparing a meeting with the CTO, now knowing that she was behind most of it. I had to reason with her. However she refused to meet with me. She told me "I don't have time. talk to your mentor, he will talk to me".

## realizing the ugly truth

These last 2 weeks I started to realize I was fighting against the wind. Everything clicked in my head. It was not what I was doing and I was not the main focus here. It was a fight also between the CEO and the CTO. It was about my boss trying to keep his seat and being afraid. It was my that problematic colleague trying to have my position. There was nothing I could do. Talking with a few friends that knew aqemia well, the main advice was: "Do like the others and leave. You will feel much better"; "Don't try to fight"

I realized that behind this was a cultural layer in the company that was explaining a lot of it.

one way of doing things and one way only

unfriendlyness of some team members. Me vs You. Out to win against you.

> Am I in a Biotech version of a Boston-Consulting-Group like French company filled with internal fights, hidden allegiences and faked behaviors?

Realizing it has never been a challenge, I had no chance.

## reverse culture shock

French way. first 4 months are like a very long interview process called trial period.

trying not to associate it with Paris

trying not to go into a nervous breakdown. 

I always found myself stronger than I thought when dealing with tough life events. However 

## leaving Aqemia

quick decision

do not stay one more day. for your sanity
