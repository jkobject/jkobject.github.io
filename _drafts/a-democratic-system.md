- capitalism/libralism/democracy has many flaws. accutely aware of but is great overall [doc capitalisme]

- why is its issue:
 - one leader, elected once and he does whatever
 - people are dumb on most things
 - people don't care on many things
 - some care more about some thing and other about other
 - states / public systems are like companies.

- solution

  - one

  - any law has a time limit of maximum 20 years.

## other unadressed flaws
  - capitalism external effects not taken in account
  - --> we need to take them in account:
    - cigarette manufacturer and consumer need to pay enough to pay for the money they cost society --> we do it already but taxes there are used for other stuff. it should be unique to the problem they cause. same or small particle emission in buyng brake systems etc..
    - CO2/methane emitter need to pay for the cost of this. --> already exist but not enough.
  - one reason is education, accepting externalities more easily and implementing  quick corrective measures. For these, public opinion should not be law but only proof should. you don't like GMO don't buy them or make better proof than anyone else, let it be reviewed by the expert governmental body and they make the choice. they cause cancer in 1 in every 100,000 person? label it and pay for the effect throuh taxes. 
  
  - let new stuff happen and decision be made on best proof. initially cigarette manufacturer could sell cigarette with shity proof that it is not problematic, then anyone can come and publish a better proof that it is (ban the sell immediately or pay the amount per pack, etc..) change happen fast, things update often. 


## how to implement any of this? 

If 50% of the population believes in it. then in a democracy, it will happen by itself. If you are not in a democracy, it might happen by itself mostly. If this idea is prevented from being spread, then you can/ shall take arms.
