- capitalism/libralism/democracy has many flaws. accutely aware of but is great overall [doc capitalisme]

- why is its issue:
 - one leader, elected once and he does whatever
 - people are dumb on most things
 - people don't care on many things
 - some care more about some thing and other about other
 - states / public systems are like companies.

- solution

  - one

  - any law has a time limit of maximum 20 years.

## other unadressed flaws
  - capitalism external effects not taken in account
  - --> we need to take them in account:
    - cigarette manufacturer and consumer need to pay enough to pay for the money they cost society --> we do it already but taxes there are used for other stuff. it should be unique to the problem they cause. same or small particle emission in buyng brake systems etc..
    - CO2/methane emitter need to pay for the cost of this. --> already exist but not enough.
  - one reason is education, accepting externalities more easily and implementing  quick corrective measures. For these, public opinion should not be law but only proof should. you don't like GMO don't buy them or make better proof than anyone else, let it be reviewed by the expert governmental body and they make the choice. they cause cancer in 1 in every 100,000 person? label it and pay for the effect throuh taxes. 
  
  - let new stuff happen and decision be made on best proof. initially cigarette manufacturer could sell cigarette with shity proof that it is not problematic, then anyone can come and publish a better proof that it is (ban the sell immediately or pay the amount per pack, etc..) change happen fast, things update often. 



## the system

- everything is a company
- current companies stay as they are.
- the current local political subdivisions stay the same and are confirmed into 7 groups:
  - commune/city/town: rank1
  - communal group: rank2
  - department: rank3
  - lander/region: rank4
  - countries: rank5
  - blocks: rank6
  - world: rank7

their political power is largely evened out compared to today and they respect the current cultural/social frontiers.

these subdivisions are also like companies: moral entities.

### evening out the power dynamics accross scales

- matter that concern N local people are voted by N local people
- no more israel vs gaza, kurdes vs ...

- rankN choose in what rankN+1 they are a part of (mostly in respect of locality)
- groups do not possess specific powers
- 

### next

- all institutions are transformed into a new kind of legal entity
  - this entity like a SAS, LTD... for companies, is associated with rules that govern it as a moral entity.
  - actions in these entities are shared evenly across all people or moral entities that have voted to be governed by them.
  - they represent very specific subpart of the current states' organisms.
    - water management
    - road management
    - juridical power
    - forest management
    - social justice
    - ethics codes 
    - economics rules
    - ...
  - anyone / any moral entity can build such an organization.
  - some are implemented in rank1 or/and rankN groups.
  - they are voted into
  - they can be voted out.
  - all their decisions / directions is behaving similarly to companies, "actionnaires" are the entities/people rules by them.
  - technological methods are used to implement the hundreds of votes a day that can be submited
  - entities have a number of voting credits per year they can use as they wish, using more than one to increase their voting power on some specific decisions
  - anyone can submit new decisions to be voted if its pledge 
  - rules implemented have a specific lifetime that is defined during the vote and cannot be more than a 100 years.
  - 

### voting per interest



### deciding the right entity based on neighboors



### locality and non locality of entities



### similarity to today's system:

#### means of failure


#### solving many things

- Can become any other political system
- Can be implemented at any scale.
- data driven based decisions

- groups influence each other through data/media/information/culture/economics

#### Examples:

- environmental issues.
  - submitted by a large amount of rank6 for the rank7 vote
  - defined that it impacts all -> voted by rank7 (all citizen)
  - specific laws are majority voted and implemented that all rank6,5,4,3,2,1 must abide by as long as they concern a problem that all face


### philosophical premises.

- liberty: to choose a way of life
- emergence: 1 human = 1 moral entity. 10 humans together = 1 moral entity
- total removal of concentration of power
- total democraty
- technology enabled
- A group of people cannot influence what another close local group does if it doesn't impact them physically.
- peace
- free flow of people
- political moral entities cannot decide to be closed to new groups


### new means of failure


## how to implement any of this? 

If 50% of the population believes in it. then in a democracy, it will happen by itself. If you are not in a democracy, it might happen by itself mostly. If this idea is prevented from being spread, then you can/ shall take arms.

- Can be implemented at any scale.
