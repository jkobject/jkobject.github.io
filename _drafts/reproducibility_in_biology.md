# reproducibility in biology - bio informatics resarch

## scientist's role

- when do we decide an experiment failed/succeded and when does it become dataselection/pvalue inflation?

- when is it showcasing a nice image and just proving a point without actual statistical significance?

- when should I choose quality or quantity?

## editors & reviewers role

- allowing data not to be released
- allowing code not to be released
- reviewing a paper without review data+code

- bashing a paper for not doing something more
- bashing a paper for lack of novelty / new proofs / new results


## better incentives
