- a graphical repesentation
- the need for more theory
- the goal: an explorable human boddy with all its elements.  (human cell atlas)
- the same with other organisms

Parse Geo and sra and.. to really create a Google of experiment. Will help people not even having to publish. As you would cite the experiments themselves, redo the experiments, comments, rank them... to really bring the possibility to meta analyse them and not redo experiments you don't need to redo based on the quality of the ones already done. I am not talking here only about sequencing but also WB, protein degradation, drug treatments... Each experiments would be searchable organized by replicates (accross labs) and citable (research paper associated or not)
