The city, 🌃 of [Queretaro](https://goo.gl/maps/v1AqC4zcLtF2) of the eponym region is placed in the center of Mexico and tops a 2000m plateau.

There I studied computer, 💻 science, design and statistics at the Tec de Monterey. We lived at 5 students (unfortunately all French friends in a big house, 🏠 in the UNESCO heritage city center.

I would be lying, to say the least, to say we worked hard during this time. My 6 month stay was filled with trips across Mexico, night out in the city, tasting amazing foods and drinks, 🍸 .

We visited [Teotihuacan](https://goo.gl/maps/4og8n1qw7oz), Mexico DF, [Puerto Escondito](https://goo.gl/maps/nwVbFpmk5o32), [Puerto Vallarta](https://goo.gl/maps/a82ZTsA2a9S2), [Morelia](https://goo.gl/maps/LKFnHVtVuu92), [Xochimilco](https://goo.gl/maps/vQhWoMSQoXL2), [Tolantongo](https://goo.gl/maps/WcNqvCZuT5P2), S[an Miguel de Allende](https://goo.gl/maps/dGKj1H7XnqK2), G[uadalajara](https://goo.gl/maps/WcbdikdDZXN2), [Xilitla](https://goo.gl/maps/tjaebNC9jFM2), S[an Luis de Potosi](https://goo.gl/maps/mieBkTBGePt), [Tequila](https://goo.gl/maps/9XEWGxYsr132) and many more.

There I had a tons of fun but also tons of problems. I was alone and could only count on myself. It taught me a lot. Things that cannot really be taught otherwise as I could not even translate it into words.

I think, 💭 it is going back from Mexico that I really became an adult. This experience was formative.
