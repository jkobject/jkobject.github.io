I have been a PhD student for a year now. Many things have happened and here is some lessons learned.

1. do it in 2 years and be prepared
2. make as many connections as I can
3. maximize impact on the community: make something useful
4. enjoy it as much as possible

## The environment


## The successes


## The difficulties


## The good and the bad of academia


## What is next?
