I have been a PhD student for a year now. Many things have happened and here is some lessons learned.

1. do it in 2 years and be prepared
2. make as many connections as I can
3. maximize impact on the community: make something useful
4. enjoy it as much as possible

## The environment

- working at Pasteur with Laura
- working at ENS with Gabriel
- the administration
- two PIs
- the incentives

## The successes

- was able to release scprint and 3 more tools
- went to over 10 events and conferences
- presented 4 times
- did 3 poster presentations
- 

## The difficulties

- hard to completely switch projects
- many more open questions about scprint
- tough to be 

## The good and the bad of academia

- the freedom
- the time for oneself to think
- the ability to connect with so many different people across the world

- the bureaucracy
- being alone a lot of the time
- the lack of structure
- one project only is tough


## What is next?

- still have a goal to do it in around 2 years
- for now I feel I have followed the path 4 points I made in the beginning
- it is becomming harder as tasks and projects pile up
