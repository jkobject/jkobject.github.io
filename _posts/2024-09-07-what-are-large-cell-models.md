In my recent paper [scPRINT](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.29.605556v1) I define the term Large Cell Model but what are they?

AI is everywhere nowadays, and in biology it is helping us enter a new era of what [jacob kimmel](https://x.com/jacobkimmel/status/1829550511768674401) describes as predictive biology.

In this new field, we use complex computational approaches together with high throughput data gathering to generate predictive models of physical phenoma like protein folding, binding, regulation, response, etc. ðŸ§¬

scPRINT, like scGPT, geneformer, scFoundation, scLM and more is part of a bread of AI tools ðŸ¤– that try to better model the cell regulation and response using a large amount of parameters and data. In this context they are -large- -cell models-. ðŸ¦
