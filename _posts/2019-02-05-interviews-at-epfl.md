During the last week of January I had the chance to enter the hiring program of [EPFL’s](https://www.epfl.ch/) edcb [program](https://phd.epfl.ch/edcb).

There I spent four days with many PIs and around twice as much students 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 all over the world interested in computational biology🧪 . Each of them were extremely bright.

Lausanne is this unique place at the center of Europe where you feel a similar atmosphere of entrepreneurship and enthusiasm and research as one would in the US.

Here I had the chance to meet with many great researchers such as Pr. Naef working on answering fundamental questions on cellular rhythms. 
Pr. La [Manno](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lwsjpbMAAAAJ&hl=fr) who tries to understand the dynamics of cellular differentiation through methods of [RNA velocity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0414-6). 
Pr. Rahi which tries to model the dynamical interaction of interaction networks in cells. 
Pr. [Barth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H7Y-wqQAAAAJ&hl=fr) which is using knowledge in protein conformation to membrane receptors applying it to cancer research and immunotherapies. 
Pr. [Manley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bXoXq2AAAAAJ&hl=fr), which is using methods of [super-resolution](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-r%C3%A9solution) microscopy to see more about cells and proteins.

As usual most of them were initially trained physicists. Each of them had specific projects using machine learning which I have been able to relate to a lot.

I also had the chance to present my past research projects (that you can find on [this website](http://www.jkobject.com)) and which slides are available online: [here](https://fr.slideshare.net/jkalfon/epfl-edcb-phd-candidate-presentation).
It seems that the researchers had a good interest in me and my background which made me very proud and enthusiastic. 
Moreover I love skiing🎿 and Lausanne is 45mns away from “les pistes”. (Which is a nice 👍 added bonus right?).
