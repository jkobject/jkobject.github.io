During the summer of 2022, I was feeling pretty desperate. I had just spent 6 months over many failed attempts at securing positions at high-profile companies like Deepmind, BenevolentAI, Isomorphic Labs, and Owkin. I had gone through very long and tedious interview processes where for some, it had felt like I was mainly just missing a Ph.D. . Some other times it felt like bad luck. Or not taking enough time outside work to review concepts.

But at the end of July, everything went very fast. I had gone through a couple of interviews at a young promising French startup called Aqemia and was quickly hired as a Research Scientist to start their target discovery team.

The pay was low and I negotiated together with stock options and a relocation bonus. I accepted it and 2 months later I was in Paris.

I will now try to present the 2 months I spent at Aqemia:

## Disclaimer:

Why am I doing that?

It is simple: I strongly believe in openness and honesty and I think the world is a better place every time someone speaks freely and openly about subject matters that have been kept behind closed doors.

I am talking here about my sole experience at Aqemia. With the management of 2022. This is just one point of view at one specific moment in time. I also have my own values and reference frame. Please do not use anyone's experience to judge a current company on this account and do your due diligence.

Because of the nature of the subject and respect for anyone currently working at Aqemia, I will keep this post private for now. If you are interested in reading it, please shout out an email and I will send it to you.

But I might at least let you know about what Aqemia was very open about as of the end of 2022:

- Aqemia is a very fast environment.
- Most people (more than half) are leaving the company after a few months. (It is not clear if this is because of Aqemia's decisions or because of their own choices).
- This percentage is higher for people with previous experience in industry and biotech. Aqemia is largely composed of young graduates.
- Aqemia is mostly composed of people coming from a small set of elite French engineering schools. They have however little knowledge in research and biology.
