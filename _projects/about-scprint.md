the goal of this project presentation is not to go through the details of the projects. Everything can be found in the paper: [scPRINT: a large cell model to predict and explain single-cell gene expression](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.10.556945v1), the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.10.556945v1) and the [code](https://github.com/jkobject/scPRINT).

No instead, I want to talk about scPRINT in a way we don't do in papers, present it as a story and talk about the lessons learned that I might not have put as much emphasis on in the paper.

## Why scPRINT


## How it was built


## What it can do


## what about gene networks


## Interesting things I learned


## What is next?
