Recent advances in [calcium imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_imaging) acquisition techniques are creating data sets of the order of Terabytes/week. Memory and computationally efficient algorithms are required to analyse in reasonable amount of time terabytes of data.

This projects implements a set of essential methods required in the calcium imaging movies analysis pipeline. Fast and scalable algorithms are implemented for motion correction, movieüçø manipulation and source and
spike extraction. CaImAn also contains some routine to the analysis of behaviour from video camerasüì∑ .
In summary, CaImAn provides a general purpose tool to handle large movies, with special emphasis toolsüß∞ for calcium imaging and behavioural data sets.

## My Involvement

This project led by [Eftychios](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fDc1X1YAAAAJ&hl=fr) Pnevmatikakis and [Andrea](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=juWp02sAAAAJ&hl=fr) Giovannucci (see my [recommandation letter](http://www.jkobject.com/documents/Andrea_Giovannucci_ecommendation.pdf)) was the one I worked on during my internship in New York City at the [Simons foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/) during the summer 2017.
I worked on the comparison project, the Graphical User interface, the documentation and many more topics.

I think that nothing can describe better what this mission was about than my [internship report](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-dyutVWzmrzV24wRzFZd3hyOHc).

CaImAn has meant a lot to me and I am very proud to announce that our paper has been submitted, accepted and published on [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/38173) very recently.
