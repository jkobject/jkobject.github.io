PiPle is the next generation professional communication tool. It is a cross platform project led by a team of Engineering student, 👩‍🎓 from [ECEparis](https://www.ece.fr/ecole-ingenieur/ece-paris/campus/) which is led by me.
We won a couple of Prizes for this project last year. The [Berger Levrault](https://www.berger-levrault.fr/) Citizen Challenge as well as [ECE innov awards](https://www.ece.fr/ecole-ingenieur/cursus/projets-etudiants/ece-innov-awards/). We are now in the midst of creating the alpha version of the project.

This one will be distributed to different companies during mid 2018. We are now composed of a team of a dozen people working part time on this complex project.

This Project came from an idea, 💡 I had during the end of my 2nd year, at my first internship. A fundamental problem in in how people communicate both at work and privately made me realise that a new way of communicating was possible. I am now leading this project since a year and a half.

Together with Paul we focus now more on managing the project, creating the business plan and the fundraising. You can send me a message on any platform if you want to back, help or work with our team at PiPle.
