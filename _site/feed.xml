&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about what I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/blog/whitelabgx-and-being-team-lead-redacted/&quot;&gt;at WhitelabGx here&lt;/a&gt; but I don’t think it would explain much of my decision. I will try to explain here the reasons that led me to this decision and the many lessons I learned along the way. 📚🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as you might be able to see in this life story of mine, I was always into science and research. I got proposed quite a few Ph.D. positions along the way. At ECE, University of Kent, EPFL, and INSERM. I applied myself to quite a few competitive places. But always found some other directions that I was more inclined to follow. It always seemed like I was pushing it for later or just thinking I could do without it. In a way I did. I went to work at the Broad Institute. Worked on many research projects, published as first-author, and even started working on my own projects. I became a research scientist in companies and even came on to lead scientists themselves during my time at Whitelab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So research, although not my only muse, has always been very dear to me.🧪🔬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems obvious that I would go on and do a Ph.D. at some point. But why did I wait? Why now? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-story&quot;&gt;The story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not looking for any other positions. I had in mind to stay 1-2 years at Whitelab Gx, see where it had gone in that time, and then make a decision about my future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was in contact with Laura Cantini with whom I had discussions about Ph.D. projects before joining Whitelab. At some point, Laura came back to me with this Ph.D. proposal. I spent the good part of a month in this tough dilemma. Thinking about it in all possible ways to try and find a solution that I would not regret in the future. 🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to explain below what led me to the decision to take this Ph.D. opportunity.
But still, I did not want to let Whitelab down. during the end of my trial period, I asked for it to be extended and explained the reason why. That gave Whitelab 2.5 months to prepare for my departure. Moreover, I presented a proposition to keep an advisory role in the company during my Ph.D. and to spend a week or so preparing my substitute for the position. I also did not take any vacation between my time at Whitelab and the Ph.D. so as to give as much time to Whitelab as I could. 🤝📅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that this goes to show my dedication and interest in the company, its mission, and the respect I have for my colleagues. 🙏🏢&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-why&quot;&gt;the why&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the opportunities I had were very exciting to me. They were allowing me to learn in some of the best environments. At Broad Institute, I learned how to do research, biology, genomics, and cutting-edge tools and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Whitelab I learned how to build a company, how to lead a team, and how to go from 0 to a validated plan, product, and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why now? Well, there is no perfect time. But I could summarize it into 1 reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Ph.D. topic and group which I believe was a great fit for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously not everything can be summarized into one reason and not everything was perfect otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whitelab was  maybe a bit too early stage for me? At least it is something I thought about sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/blog/whitelabgx-and-being-team-lead-redacted/&quot;&gt;see Whitelab post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I thought a lot about open source in computational biology and having an impact which I will be able to outline further in this post.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also had a couple  disillusions during job interviews with some high profile companies. 🏢🚀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while working at Whitelab and even before that, I started to notice a change in the community. AI is slowly becoming more and more powerful and solving real biological problems. I saw it from foundation models in structural biology -with equivariant models and protein language models-, to transcriptomics and DNA language models.🤖🧬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my work on celligner2 -at Broad-, I could already envision how foundational models would help in many aspects of my problem and many others. Working on the Atlas at Whitelab, they were always in our minds in many of our real-world scientific problems (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/blog/whitelabgx-and-being-team-lead-redacted/&quot;&gt;see my Whitelab post&lt;/a&gt;). (wait for a potential paper from our team at Whitelab in “nature computational science perspectives”) I had so many projects in mind and so little time to try to tackle them.💡📝&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also could see the speed of development of new papers and the breadth of possible research endeavors available to computational biologists. So there was some FOMO there for sure and I knew that if an AI-heavy transcriptomic research project was coming my way I might not say no.📈📊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I received this proposal from Laura and Gabriel I was very excited. It felt like the perfect fit for me. It had it all plus lots of applied math and stats plus gene regulatory networks which I spent years studying with Max Pimkin.💯📈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;issues-and-realizations&quot;&gt;issues and realizations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not the only reason: Before joining Whitelab and moving to France, I had interviewed at a few companies: BenevolentAI, DeepMind, Isomorphic Labs, Owkin, and DeepLife, and applied to many more. I could see for many of them that my not having a Ph.D. was an issue. I even strongly believe that it prevented me from joining a couple of those companies.🎓❌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other companies, like Whitelab or Aqemia, were very clear that my experience, to them was worth much more than what most Ph.D.s would bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this really made me realize that life would be that much tougher without this diploma and that many doors would be closed or harder to open.🚪🔐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, working in startup companies, I noticed their needs and challenges, some of them I believe specific to European startups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding in Europe is often much smaller than in the US, especially for seed and series A. This is problematic for biotech companies that need high CAPEX from the get-go to hire the best people, do experimental validation, build experimental facilities, and create a first pipeline. This is creating a state of slower initial growth than for their American counterpart.💰💼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem to some like a small problem but it can become soul-crushing if you have been in the same company for years, waiting for it to enter exponential growth. It also can create issues, as the companies will lack key positions like CTOs, and HR managers, and the necessary power balance between the different stakeholders in the company.📉🤝&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another realization I have had in both companies I was at, is the open-sourcing scare.😱📦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-source-and-creating-value&quot;&gt;Open-source and creating value&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing biologists and Business Developers, I can guess this is an issue in many if not most (non-GAFAM) companies. “Use as many open source software and tutorials as you want”, “but don’t open source anything we do, don’t talk about anything we do”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, since it is something that can get copied and pasted so easily, scarcity has to be artificial.
However open source and open science are often beneficial as everyone can collaborate together and build on top of each other’s work. This is the inherent innovation and progress phenomena built into software development and research.🔍🌐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, external pressures tend to force privacy towards innovation to keep it for oneself.🤐🔬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that for projects in which the result is very far off or unclear, this is even more important. If you are building a product like a lamp, say. You cannot cheat, will the lamp stay on for X years? this will define your company. For something like Facebook, even, you get usage metrics from very early on. For Biotechs, computational biology, and research. There might not be such a clear-cut goal: “Can you get people to believe in you to enter a partnership with you to try to figure out this thing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, you can lie. You can lie to the client but also to yourself. You can design a very nice-looking “car” that doesn’t drive at all. but since you are selling to people who don’t even really understand what is a car and what to do with it: it might be okay.🚗🤫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I think open source is so important: when you let people know how to use a car, try your car, you cannot lie.📚🚗&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computational biologists should prioritize companies and positions where they can build tools that will have a direct impact, through open source and through experimental validation. This is still rare and it requires tough lobbying when this isn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a big lesson learned for me too. Thinking more about global impact, direct impact, value creation, and value capture.🌍📈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hard-decision&quot;&gt;the hard decision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite reasons to doubt as always nothing was pushing me away from my current job and I felt welcomed, useful and that we were going forward in our grand vision. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/blog/whitelabgx-and-being-team-lead-redacted/&quot;&gt;See the Whitelab post&lt;/a&gt; to under why also this was such a hard decision for me to take. It really felt like choosing the hard thing, the hard path. But in a more subtle way, it feels like doing the right thing.🤔🛤️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a hard decision because of how it might be seen too.
I so do not want people to see it as doing a U-turn, or as a start-over. To me, it is more of a continuation of my professional career. Ph.D.s can be many things and I see mine much more like a post-doc or a long sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know have 5 years of experience in computational biology and I am afraid of hearing “you are just fresh out of your Ph.D. and we thus don’t think you are yet qualified for a lead role in our company.” from an HR manager after my Ph.D.📆👨‍💼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover Staying for such a short period in companies is not seen well. For very sensible reasons. I have stayed 2.5 months at Aqemia and now 7.5 months at Whitelab.🏢⌛&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But startups are a special environment, especially early-stage series A European companies. I have stayed for 3.5 years at Broad. Much longer than most people in my position. I have worked on my project, PiPle, for more than 5 years. I also think I have shown how much I cared for Whitelab and the personal dedication I have put in and continue to, in the company. 🌟🤝&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I feel I have actually learned a lot more in these 10 months than I had in a long time. From structural biology and drug discovery to business and management, the startup ecosystem, and cell and gene therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-many-lessons-learned&quot;&gt;the many lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my previous experience in building a company, I would not have expected to learn that much from being in a startup. I think I missed that going from 1 to 5 is really not the same as 5 to 20 and 20 -to 100, etc… each growth cycle is a full reinvention of the culture, it is new challenges and things get exponentially more complex for the C-levels (i.e. the executive team: CEO, CTO, CSO, CFO, HR manager, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;being-a-great-c-level-in-a-startup&quot;&gt;being a great C-level in a startup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It shows how much of an example they are for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the 4 points I learned for the C-levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The C-levels’ domain knowledge is key to success. 💼🧠🔑&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to create agile processes and to hire the right people at the right time is also key to success. 🔄👥⏰🔑&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fostering a culture of trust and respect is how you can keep the best people in your company. 🤝💼&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might seem obvious but I really was shocked by the Impact of C levels on a startup culture. I was shocked also by the key “glue role” that C-levels need to play during this 1-100 people size. They are the connection between people inside the company and the partners outside it.🚀🔗
It shows how much of an example they are for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the example they set needs is a constant balancing act between everyone’s needs and goals. Within all this chaos they need to keep fostering a culture of trust and respect. This “keep cool” in most situations is as hard as the balancing act they constantly play. 🤹‍♀️🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, their domain knowledge 💼🧠🔑 is key to success. This requires experience in their topic and what their clients and the market want. M.D.s, Ph.D.s, business developers, and Engineers, all with experience in their field are of the utmost importance in biotech. It is a complicated field layered with traps, fakes, and mistakes. 🌡️📈📚&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this trickles down when you start asking yourself: “How do I hire the best people?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In here C levels again play a key role. The culture they have fostered allows them to keep the best people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to also have their work be fulfilling and complete while being on high growth. Processes and being agile 🔄👥⏰🔑 is also super important to structure ideas/projects and gather everyone’s strength and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thinking-differently-than-in-academia&quot;&gt;Thinking differently than in academia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a startup has many similarities with being a researcher. You have ideas you need to sell through a powerful story. This is how you get people and funding. These ideas although incomplete have to convince people. You spend a lot of time finding money and building a team of experts and beginners.💡💰👥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if it was that similar. Every CEO would be an ex-PI. There are big differences. The first few discussions with the BD team at Whitelab sometimes gave me “aha” moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to know what you are selling and what people want. Even though you might not have it yet. What counts is that you know you are able to have it and how you would do it.
Putting yourself out. to as many conferences and events, with a solution to people’s problems needs to happen from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your first product might be miserable, but if it solves someone’s problem, it’s okay. And thinking product first, even in comp bio, is not really a reflex. What is a product? when you see all these amazing databases, datasets, and tools. What does one bring? You don’t have to bring much initially. A product is really just this abstraction over the work that your team does to produce the result. Except it has to be polished. People want deadlines, outputs, cost estimates, and other requirements.🗂️📅📋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do inside is not really important to the “product” concept. It is important for the product to be good. But not for you to have a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-of-cell-and-gene-therapies&quot;&gt;The future of cell and gene therapies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Whitelab because I strongly believe in the future of genetic therapies. Covid opened our eyes to the power of mRNAs, CAR-Ts have had a big impact on cancer therapies and many more are in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially seeing the issues with small molecules. It felt to me that we needed a more targeted approach to the medicine of the future.💉🧬🌐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, what are cell and gene therapies (CGT)s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cell and gene therapies (CGTs) represent a revolutionary approach to disease treatment, moving away from traditional methods towards more targeted and personalized solutions. These therapies work by altering the genetic material within a patient’s cells to fight or prevent disease. They can replace or repair abnormal genes, introduce new genes to fight disease or modulate the expression of an individual’s genes.🧬💊🌡️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very famous subcategory: mRNA therapies, such as those used in some COVID-19 vaccines, are a type of gene therapy that works by introducing a small piece of mRNA into the body. This mRNA carries the instructions for making a protein, and once inside our cells, it uses the body’s own machinery to produce this protein. The produced protein then triggers an immune response. The advantage of mRNA therapies is that they don’t alter the DNA in our cells and are not permanent, reducing the risk of long-term side effects.💉🦠🧬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are another type of CGT that work by binding to the mRNA produced by certain genes and preventing them from being translated into proteins. This can be useful for diseases where a particular gene is overactive. ASOs can be designed to target almost any gene, making them a highly versatile tool in the fight against disease.💉🎯🧬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the main advantage of CGTs is their precision. They target the root cause of diseases at the genetic level, offering the potential for more effective and longer-lasting treatments with fewer side effects. This precision, combined with the rapid advancements in technology and our understanding of the human genome, is why many believe CGTs represent the future of medicine.💉🌍🔬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that since genetic sequencing and machine learning, we are able to understand the root cause of disease in the name of one or a few cell types and their disregulation caused by often one or a few genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to target only these specific diseased cell types is within reach for CGTs but not for small molecules. Moreover being specific in what we are doing: what genes we are triggering is also what CGTs can do that most small molecules, for their pleiotropy, can’t&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like a perfect CGT would allow us to create a novel drug in hours. From a laptop and a DNA printing machine. It would be the perfect interface between man and life: The human-life interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-goals-and-objectives-for-the-phd&quot;&gt;My goals and objectives for the Ph.D.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A main mistake during one’s Ph.D. is to not see the time passing by. My goal for this Ph.D. is to be as product-first as I was at Whitelab. Delivering results quickly &amp;amp; improving until it is publishable.🏆📊📚&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mistake, thinking “Well I have 3 years…” is what makes people go overboard, finish stressed, and unprepared for what is next. Thus I plan for doing mine in 2 years. And I will prepare everything around this idea. I will also start to think about what is next ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that best, one needs to take the chance of the Ph.D. to make connections with other labs (industry or academic) on my end I am thinking for example at Broad, the Theis lab, the Yosef lab, Valence labs, …🤝🔗&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a good advice I have been given is to know what you want to do and what you don’t want to do. Know what you are here for. Learn to say no. And I learned to say no in the last 4 years. My goal is to work on large models &amp;amp; large datasets, mostly transcriptomics. But also making sure to always go back to first principles and biology.🧬🧪🔍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know I want to make something useful, make something that can be a stepping stone for others. Something that has an impact on the community. I know that to do that you have to go the extra mile in terms of dev with and be honest with yourself about any shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have been very lucky to often become addicted to my work. I like working hard and I like challenges. But for this to happen, I need to keep enjoying what I am doing. I also wish to have no regrets about this decision.
Thus my final goal is to enjoy it, as much as I can!😊🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus my motto for this Ph.D. will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;do it in 2 years and be prepared&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make as many connections as I can&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;maximize impact on the community: make something useful&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;enjoy it as much as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phd-proposal&quot;&gt;Ph.D. proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;previous-proposals&quot;&gt;Previous proposals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had a previous Ph.D. projects proposals for a Ph.D. that I then postponed. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/assets/documents/researchobjectives.pdf&quot;&gt;list it here&lt;/a&gt; too for historical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jérémie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="PhD" /><category term="Startups" /><category term="Comp-Bio" /><summary type="html">I take a big decision and provide many lessons learned along the way, about leading teams, companies, doing a Ph.D. and working in startups</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My Work at Whitelab and Creating a Team</title><link href="https://jkobject.com/blog/WhitelabGx-and-being-team-lead-redacted/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Work at Whitelab and Creating a Team" /><published>2023-09-25T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-09-25T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://jkobject.com/blog/WhitelabGx-and-being-team-lead-redacted</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jkobject.com/blog/WhitelabGx-and-being-team-lead-redacted/">&lt;p&gt;After a very deceptive end of the year, I decided I wanted to take a month or so to get my thoughts in order. To relax and find some peace with what had happened. :peace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the day following my departure I was already looking at companies and contacting labs. 📱 I was in this state where the only thing that could make me feel better was to look at the future and the possibilities. 💭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was still tough mentally, I was thinking about the option of going back to the Broad Institute. “Would it be hard? Should I go now? Would it be the easy way out? What about my apartment, my girlfriend? etc.” I felt like a way out, like cowardly going back “home” 🏠 after a failed attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had, fortunately, all the support I could need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It actually only took a week or so before I got replies. One coming from Deep Life and one from WhitelabGx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up being offered positions, but the choice was easy. DeepLife’s management seems to have a few red flags 🟥 in their behavior during my couple of meetings. After my previous experience, this is something I was now much more sensitive to. I was not really able to see these before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whitelab on the other hand was very welcoming. Excited about my profile and offered me a very rewarding position, especially compared to DeepLife. I would be a team lead in Computational Biology :muscle:. Here I saw how much my previous experience was valuable as I felt I was now much more able to see in between the lines during recruitment processes. Not what people say, but how they behave, what they offer, and the way they do it. Doing so I could also see the tremendous difference between how companies can see or not someone’s value and potential:moneybag:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, it is like friendship. It is a matter of taste, need but most of all serendipity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, the position looked a lot like what I had been told at Aqemia (although not really offered). But here, the team was already there waiting for me and the objectives were clear. 🥇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-environment&quot;&gt;the environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things were green flags 🟩 for me. The company was actually thinking of itself as a Biotech, the CSO was a biologist with experience. They had an HR manager. They also had a team of biologists and both the CEO / CSO were very honest, aware of what they didn’t know, and were very open to my suggestions and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place itself was a brand new incubator 👀 called Future4Care. As nice as Broad and less than 10 minutes from my place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every member of the team was nice and welcoming. It was small, however: 20 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of WhitelabGx is to build a platform to help develop, de-risk, and fasten the preclinical phase of novel cell and gene therapies. The idea is to use ML and data science to drive the discovery, experimental design, and so on 📈.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially after getting experience in small molecule preclinical development, I could see the huge potential of CGTs in their precision compared to regular small molecules. I also believe strongly that many diseases will only be cured through the use of CGTs. Finally, it is also a nice experience to add to my resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I doing that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simple: I strongly believe in openness and honesty and I think the world is a better place every time someone speaks freely and openly about subject matters that have been kept behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am talking here about my sole experience at WhitelabGx. With the management of 2023. This is just one point of view at one specific moment in time. I also have my own values and reference frame. Please do not use anyone’s past experience to judge a current company on this account and do your own due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of the subject and with respect for anyone currently working at WhitelabGx, I will keep this post private for now. If you are interested in reading it, please send out an email and I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I might at least let you know about what WhitelabGx was very open about as of the end of 2023:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whitelab has a culture of kindness and honesty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Almost everyone is staying in the company after their trial period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whitelab is largely composed of people with past experience in research, biotech, and biology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whitelab is very diverse, exactly half of the company is non-french. with people coming from all over the world. The culture is very American.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I had just experienced 6 months of many failed attempts at securing positions at high-profile companies like Deepmind, BenevolentAI, Isomorphic Labs, and Owkin. I had gone through very long and tedious interview processes where for some, it had felt like I was mainly just missing a Ph.D.. Some other times it felt like bad luck. Or maybe I had not taken enough time outside work to review some important concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the end of July, everything went very fast. I had gone through a couple of interviews at a young promising French startup called Aqemia and was quickly hired as a Research Scientist to start their target discovery team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pay was low compared to where I was coming from and I negotiated stock options and a relocation bonus. I accepted the offer and 2 months later I was in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will now try to present the 2 months I spent at Aqemia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why am I doing that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simple: I strongly believe in openness and honesty and I think the world is a better place every time someone speaks freely and openly about subject matters that have been kept behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am talking here about my sole experience at Aqemia with the management team of 2022. This is just one point of view at one specific moment in time. I also have my own values and reference frame that are at play. Please do not use anyone’s experience to judge a current company on this account and do your due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of the subject and respect for anyone currently working at Aqemia, I will keep this post private for now. If you are interested in reading it, please shout out an email and I will send it to you.
But I might at least let you know about what Aqemia was very open about as of the end of 2022:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aqemia is a very fast environment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lot of people -more than half- leave the company after a few months. It is not clear if this is because of Aqemia’s decisions or because of their own.
This percentage seemed higher for people with previous experience in industry and biotech.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is largely composed of young graduates from a small set of elite French engineering schools. They have, however, little experience in biomedical research and biology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Are you crazy?” 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I think there are many good reasons for it and I will try to explain why. But, before I go into the why, let’s talk about the last 1.5 years at Broad and what I have been able to do. 🔍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;35-years-at-the-broad&quot;&gt;3.5 years at the Broad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been quite some changes and many successes in the recent year. I have finished my main research project at DFCI with Maxim Pimkin and I have now been 100% a Broadie. :partying_face:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My two main projects have been on what I liked to call CCLE3 and Celligner2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;depmap-omics-ccle3&quot;&gt;DepMap Omics: CCLE3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancerdatascience.org/&quot;&gt;CDS&lt;/a&gt;, some people have come and gone, mainly someone joined my team: Simone Zhang. Taking more Engineering responsibilities from me and helping me on the depmap-omics project. 💪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also quickly promoted to Senior Associate Computational Biologist. The last ladder before becoming a Research Scientist at Broad. Simone coming was also given to me as a way to show my ability to coach and be a mentor to a junior scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allowed us to define a lot more avenues of research, which I packaged into a project called: CCLE3. 💡&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main question was: “What can we do with the data we have at the Broad, in depmap-omics, to help the community?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was proud to be given the responsibility of presenting this vision to the Cancer Program leadership in 2021. Here is the presentation I gave:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JifqKvIVmwEtroBxgZAq5avyLnACnC2xNt6V5j3bbus/edit#slide=id.g123f2acd6c3_0_171&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly one can see that it was axed around the idea of generating novel features from omics data we already have, improving the metadata, and harmonizing our omics. having the same sequencing data across all our samples -at least for RNAseq &amp;amp; WGS-. 🟩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly believed -and still do- that these were the low-hanging fruits 🥝 for us, allowing us to discover new targets cheaply and squeeze more value out of our current database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me present that in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;new features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that in the last 2 years, we have made an impact on the community by open-sourcing our toolkit and making our data reproducible and more generally available. 📖&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from all the fancy Machine Learning and prediction tools we have tried and designed to make better predictions of gene dependency &amp;amp; cancer targets. Almost every time, without a doubt, nothing had a greater impact than generating a new genomic feature from our dataset. 🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a big “lessons learned”, for me at least. That data comes first and domain knowledge comes second. I think this is a lesson that is not only true for genomics but for all data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me present some of the new features we have developed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recreating &amp;amp; improving the microsatellite instabilities from DNAseq –&amp;gt; initially lead to the WRN / MSI paper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Associating features based on gene sets, gene proximity, etc.. –&amp;gt; initially lead to the 2022 VPS4A/VPS4B paper&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting info about viral infection of the tumor sample.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting at somatic &amp;amp; germline structural variants from WES and WGS and associating them with fusion variants in RNAseq –&amp;gt; Lead to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/82/12_Supplement/2710/703992&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://beroukhimlab.org/publications/&quot;&gt;Rameen Beroukhim lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;getting info about splicing QTLs using spliceAI on mutation data and associating them with transcript abundance –&amp;gt; paper in progress as of 2023 also with the Beroukhim lab.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;getting info about the global functional status of genes (based on CNV/SV/SNPs/ INDELS/ etc) and their phasing and expression –&amp;gt; has already been shown to improve most of our dependency prediction data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Germline mutations &amp;amp; their associations to dependency –&amp;gt; something I pushed for a lot. And led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/82/12_Supplement/2173/703368&quot;&gt;couple papers&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517155v1.abstract&quot;&gt;ancestry bias&lt;/a&gt; with Sean Misek and improvement of our Achilles Algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last project is one which I was really proud 🥇 of as it is something I had pushed for two years without much success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until Sean, a new research scientist in the Beroukhim lab, was able to help me convince the rest of the team that this would be a worthwhile endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Broad’s 2021 Retreat, I was able to present this work to the whole Broad community. Here is the poster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wqyzTE5qctXq33Lq7VwI1UK7cPBnEIkf_yczeUMH8Gs/edit#slide=id.p1&quot;&gt;poster broad retreat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sad that despite publishing a couple of first-author papers and being part of a dozen other collaborations, 🙄 I was not able to see from that even a hint of a CCLE3 paper. I hope it will be published someday but I have been told that to be guaranteed a Nature, one needs more than new features and new predictions, one -apparently- also needs a crazy new sequencing dataset 🗻 (a la Broad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;metadata-improvement&quot;&gt;metadata improvement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MetaData had always been one of our Achilles’ heel. We knew they were not great but we also knew that no one had great metadata for their cell line. What made the group become quickly convinced to start working on it, was how much better any improvement made the prediction algorithm work. Seeing that we started running many parallel efforts to map duplicate samples (using genomics), similar-looking models (using transcriptomics), sex, age, etc. :bar_chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we started merging our cell line annotations with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cellosaurus.org/index.html&quot;&gt;Cellosaurus&lt;/a&gt; to discover more issues in both our databases and started merging our disease annotations with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ncit&quot;&gt;NCIT&lt;/a&gt; to realize that many more cancers than we thought were related in some way. or were simply improbable annotations. 🧭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort is also something I had pushed for, for a while, and reused many of the improvements I had already put forward. This is also something I am proud of. I think it is a great example of how such a small, boring effort can have a big impact on science and therapeutic discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-steps-for-sequencing&quot;&gt;next steps for sequencing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, since it is the Broad, in 2019 we had goals of going 10x in the coming years. However, we soon realize that there were not a lot of “good” models left 🪹 and that our capacity for creating them was very limited. We wanted more cell lines / 3D models but it was hard to get good ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that we have 12 different sequencing data types for 1700 lines but almost none of them have all of those sequencing 🧬 done, our first goal was to do WGS &amp;amp; RNAseq on everything. representing more than 200 RNAseq and 1000 WGS, the reordering of 400 lines, and the likely drop of dozens of lines that do not exist anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because these are the low-hanging fruits for us. Without changing anything, without generating new models, and changing pipelines and platform, we just get a lot more information allowing us to discover new targets cheaply and squeeze more value out of our current database. When your model can work on modality A+B+C but only 300 samples / 1700 have each of those modalities, you are missing out on a lot of potential. 🟩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a second objective. Even more ambitious came to us in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buenrostrolab.com/&quot;&gt;Jason Buenrostro&lt;/a&gt;: Inventor of ATACseq &amp;amp; SHARE-seq. Jason wanted to apply SHARE-seq to all our cell lines. likely millions of cells. Then, apply it for post-perturbation 🔫. This would allow us to see the effect of a drug on the chromatin accessibility of a cell line and its expression at single-cell resolution. This was a very exciting project. And I was tasked to coordinate it on the CDS side by Paquita Vazquez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this was not all, and the other half of my time was also spent on a pet peeve of mine: Celligner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;celligner2-and-the-hint-of-foundational-models&quot;&gt;Celligner2 and the hint of foundational models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celligner was initially developed by Allie Warren. Its goal is to align bulk RNAseq data from cancer models (CCLE) with data from patients’ tumors (TCGA). Comparing the two 🍎 / 🍊 to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;assess annotation quality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;assess model quality as its similarity to the patient’s tumor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;assess model coverage &amp;amp; diversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, they don’t align well and one needs to apply an alignment method for those datasets to work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did that by reusing the MNN tool from Seurat and adding in additional preprocessing using contrastive PCA, differential expression, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project work very well and led to a lot of excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Allie left, I took over the project and started working on a new version of the tool. I wanted to answer biologists’ needs. Initially by adding new features and making the tool more scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I soon started to think that we could do so much more by using a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reusing VAE-based autoencoders like scVI and scArches and training them to make a model look like a tumor and vice versa. Training them to predict features like tumor type, sex, and age. And using explainable AI (XAI) 🗨️ to understand what the model was learning and what gene sets and pathways were explaining these features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually went pretty far with this and I started making early presentations for the team. 🧑‍🔬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gvuVkxLUJCql1lE5z_l0AEKwAZY9-rLNhI8MRygDfhc/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I showed many interesting results that could have fit into a paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior Members were intrigued by 2 ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using annotations during training as semi-supervision constraints to improve model quality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using additional data like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gtexportal.org/&quot;&gt;GTEX&lt;/a&gt; that was containing normal samples as a way to also improve model quality. 💹&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first part, the debate was mostly around: “What if the annotation is wrong?”, “what about overfitting to annotations?”, “it seems like using what you will test your model on”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was able to show that since it was only part of the loss function, it was not leading to this issue. By making wrongful annotations, up to a point, the model was able to still create the right mapping (e.g. fake “lung models” 🫁 that were actually “breast models” were still aligning with breast cancer). Moreover adding these annotations was in fact improving the model quality, and quality here is defined not by annotation but by many other metrics 📈 as shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/theislab/scib&quot;&gt;scIB package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second part, it just seemed nonsensical to some to use data that was not cancer: “What does it mean to align normals to cancer?”, “Is it really useful?”, “Why do you want to do this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think here I had the first hint of what would soon be the foundation models in scRNAseq that would come out in the following year. I was seeing Gtex as pretraining. Helping the neural network to also learn how genes are related and differences in tissues. I was seeing it as a way to make the model more robust and more generalizable. 🧠 It showed in the metrics that doing that was improving the model on every downstream tasks. It was also interesting to see cancers that were mapping to their original tissue of origin and the ones that were completely diverging. 📉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Celligner project was going well, the results were there. However many changes at CDS and Broad came together to slowly end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leaving-broad&quot;&gt;Leaving Broad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year at Broad 3 prominent colleagues left Broad: CDS founder Aviad Tsherniak, CDS director James McFarland, and Javad Noorbakhsh. This departure of multiple colleagues was a lot but it was also the only 3 people pushing for Celligner and bringing more AI in CDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there was a change in the cancer program leadership itself. With Eric Lander, Broad’s Director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/05/28/u-s-senate-unanimously-confirms-dr-eric-lander-to-become-director-of-the-white-house-office-of-science-and-technology-policy/&quot;&gt;leaving for Senate&lt;/a&gt; 🇺🇸 (and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/two-scientists-will-replace-u-s-science-adviser-eric-lander/&quot;&gt;quickly leaving&lt;/a&gt; 🙊 ). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/todd-r-golub&quot;&gt;Todd Golub&lt;/a&gt; became Broad’s new director and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/william-sellers&quot;&gt;Bill Sellers&lt;/a&gt;, a world-renowned cancer scientist from Novartis and heavily involved in CCLE and DepMap, became the new cancer program’s director ♋ .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill wanted to rationalize a bit more the objectives of the Cancer Program toward drug discovery. And he wanted to do that by focusing on a few key areas :bow_and_arrow: . This meant that some projects were going to be stopped and some others were going to be prioritized. So you can guess where this is going for Celligner… 🛑&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the new projects were still very exciting. But other factors were very important in my decision too. I was missing my family, my father was ill, I could see that life was moving fast for my siblings and my friends. I felt that I had to take a life decision: I had to make a choice and decided to move back to France. 🇫🇷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t take you through covid’s time and my SO being away too (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/blog/two-years-at-the-broad/&quot;&gt;2 years at Broad&lt;/a&gt;) but everything played a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got a sense that I need to see drug development firsthand. I need to get back in the weeds of building a company and a project. I spent a year doing that before Broad and such a fast-paced. product-first 📦 environment is also something that I am missing. I will try to see what I can do in the field of target discovery with this acquired knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no time I got into this up-and-coming French StartUp called Aqemia. Let’s see what is next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see what I presented to the companies 🏛️ I have applied to. Here is my &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Uz6ZW13MwWot8yChssegNPPmknPvb0HJcLXyGHOqSIo/edit#slide=id.g12f138bad5c_0_972&quot;&gt;interview presentation&lt;/a&gt;, used in a couple fancy companies’ interview 😁.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jérémie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="BroadInstitute" /><category term="Computational Biology" /><category term="Data Science" /><category term="Associate Computational Biologist" /><summary type="html">It has been an epic journey.

Part of my work at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jkobject.com/blog/2021-06-11-two-years-at-the-broad&quot;&gt;Broad Institute&lt;/a&gt; was to take charge of the burgeoning computational pipeline that was DepMap Omics 🏋️.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DepMap Omics represents first a big dataset that was made through a multi-year project by Mahmoud Ghandi, Bill Sellers, Aviad Tsherniak, Paquita Vazquez, and many other collaborators, initially called &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle/&quot;&gt;CCLE&lt;/a&gt;, or Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. 📚 It contained multi-omics sequencing from aa thousand cancer models such as WESeq, RRBSeq, RNAseq, HybridCaptureseq, RainDanceseq, etc. :sweat_drops: Some of it was done at the Broad, some elsewhere. This all took years to produce, analyze and publish. It uncovered many key results and new dependencies related to specific cancer genetic features. Unfortunately for me, the paper was already finalized when I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something else was also happening in parallel, the new DepMap project was also recently launched and its objective was to create and add as many cell lines as possible and release the viability results of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://depmap.org/portal/&quot;&gt;genome-wide knockouts/knockdowns&lt;/a&gt; to the public. 🗣️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to finance all this. How did we do it? Well, first using Broad’s money, but also using private partners, like many big pharma companies and also tech companies. 🤑 This is how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://depmap.org/portal/home/#/depmap-consortium&quot;&gt;DepMap consortium (DMC)&lt;/a&gt; was launched. I won’t go into too many details regarding this as I don’t know how much can be freely divulged. What was important is that we had new deadlines: release updated datasets every 3 months…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thus had to transfer a multi-year research project composed of many R scripts into a computational pipeline that could load new data, make production-level data releases, and likely scale to 10x the amount of data. This is when I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this lesson learned, I will talk about what we learned in building this large-scale multi-omics pipeline for target discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People that have had to do that kind of thing will know the many challenges involved. For others just know that in such a context, you are fighting daily against Occam’s razor: Any possible bug is going to happen at some point. But I will come back to it since our first issue was actually: “Where is our data?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Where is our data?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-management&quot;&gt;Data management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the data had not necessarily been correctly registered after the CCLE2 project and even then most datasets that were easily available were the processed output matrices. Finding the raw reads (i.e. the sequencing fastq files) became very difficult for some sources and some samples had to be reanalyzed or altogether dropped from subsequent releases due to lack of raw data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, the question is how do we move forward and what can we do so that this never happens again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did our research and better and better sample management tools have come to life in recent years. I will list some here that I highly advise you to look into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xenabrowser.net/&quot;&gt;xena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/&quot;&gt;gdc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra&quot;&gt;sra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dnanexus.com/&quot;&gt;dnanexus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.synapse.org/&quot;&gt;synapse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://terra.bio/&quot;&gt;terra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ega-archive.org/&quot;&gt;ega&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am also very eager to learn of other similar tools (feel free to post in the comments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools listed are the state of the art for genomics data management. But all have flaws. Some of them are for long-term storage or only for public access, some of them are made for specific datasets, etc.
Thus I will say it is almost impossible to just base the data architecture of your project around only one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we ended up finding easier is to use a mix of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;synapse&lt;/strong&gt; (for output data management, and sharing output data with the public and within our team).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;terra&lt;/strong&gt; for data processing and processing output storage management.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;google cloud storage&lt;/strong&gt; for longer-term storage, larger files, and sharing data within our team and collaborators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sra&lt;/strong&gt; for sharing data with the public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We had our copycat of Synapse internally but for all intents and purposes you can consider it to be like a paid version of Synapse. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as is often the case in large collaborations, things were more complex. In total, from the onboarding of samples to the data that become available to the public, we actually used many more software, all with many interconnections and handled by various teams scripts and cloud functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dozens of google-spreadsheets 🤮&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxspan.com/&quot;&gt;arxspan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/fr/software/jira&quot;&gt;jirra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/files/shared/biosamples/ISBER_Mahan_2008.pdf&quot;&gt;bsp&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;- a broad internal tool like arxspan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them were because different teams had different needs for sample metadata management.
What can we do against it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sample-metadata-management&quot;&gt;sample metadata management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When? The sooner the better. This is akin to the many efforts of Knowledge Graphs in companies. The goal is that all this knowledge generated about your project, samples, or whatever gets put into a relational database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to have that is to ensure that there is a team whose goal and responsibility is to build the infrastructure that will interconnect everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what we learned here is that there are a few pillars that the database has to have: 🗽&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;modular&lt;/strong&gt;: it needs to be very modular and can be updated easily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reliable&lt;/strong&gt;: it should rarely break and not for longer than a few hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;queriable&lt;/strong&gt;: it needs to be queried very simply in Python / R and other languages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accessible&lt;/strong&gt;: people should be able to get many important data about the database and to view it as a table. Important data like the number of edits, who makes the most edits, and what are the possible values for a specific field.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interoperable&lt;/strong&gt;: people should be able to share subparts of the table to others or export it in other formats to others. (CSV, spreadsheet, …)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;findable&lt;/strong&gt;: most people should see most of the database. people that generate the data should be able to write on their respective fields and be allowed to add new data. New data should be added through a form-like page that verifies the entries, explain potential errors, and display examples for entries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;access controlled&lt;/strong&gt;: this is a management problem too but you do not want people writing new data to spreadsheets and notebooks because they haven’t received the right access. You also don’t want edits made by anyone. Edits should be allowed to have comments for the DB management team to let them know that something like a new field or an additional value needs to be added. Moreover, all or most entries should be well controlled with specific dictionaries (snake_case, no majuscules) and ranges. Last, but not least, define a minimum viable set of values for a specific entry, a sample has to have at least these N values or it is rejected. Be uncompromising on these rules. You will be thanked later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACID&lt;/strong&gt;, etc: and of course you want all the basics of a database, unique ID (eg. auto increment), atomicity, …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versionned&lt;/strong&gt;: if an error is made, one should be able to know who made it, and revert to previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you could see the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;FAIR principles&lt;/a&gt; in here, good job. If you couldn’t please look at the link it will be better explained than I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a final remark: if possible, connecting overlapping databases from internal or external (interoperable) sources to yours, will be extremely valuable. This allows you to spot issues in your database and more. We have been able to greatly improve ours this way. :medal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dataset-management&quot;&gt;dataset management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While small datasets can be put on GitHub or Fileshare which both come with a great number of safeguards and policies on versioning etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as you do a good enough job of consistently naming and describing your datasets, you should be fine. Ah hem… &lt;strong&gt;GOOD ENOUGH&lt;/strong&gt; 🥉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For larger files, however, 🧬 we have mentioned Google storage and although many other tools exist I can vouch for the quality and reliability of google cloud.
&lt;em&gt;looking at you AWS, please stop becomming the 2000s era microsoft of cloud providers&lt;/em&gt; #unpopular-opinion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, google storage is not helping you that much more and you will want to have internal rules about your dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you want to think about in advance is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;versioning&lt;/strong&gt;: how much, how long…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;access control&lt;/strong&gt;: who has access (read, write)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;storage class&lt;/strong&gt;: how often do you want to access the data, how fast do you want it to be, and how much are you willing to pay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However these decisions tend to become more automatized nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite similar topics to the metadata, except you won’t have the ability to be as stringent for large files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional tools in google cloud (e.g. google big query) can become of use to you although I haven’t made as much use of them and won’t mention them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One remark is that many providers might let you store your data in their managed environment. We have noticed that, for large files, we have almost always returned to a bare-bone tool like Google storage due to missing functionality in other providers. &lt;em&gt;looking at you Terra.bio&lt;/em&gt;. 🔍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final remark&lt;/strong&gt;: bam files, vcfs, … and largely most indexable files can be index-queried directly from google cloud. This is a huge upside that you ought to look into. Especially if you don’t know what I am referring to here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-management&quot;&gt;code management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;same repo for everyone. In science, big is the drive of many of your teammates to use your code, add / change something to make it better and then never tell anyone about it. Just pressure your peers into pushing their changes. You might have to be lenient on code quality and good practices but it will be worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;once they have done it. And if they start contributing a bit more, you might start to push them to use versioning. “make a few commits along the way and let me know what you are changing”. Say it calmly and repeat it as much as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then go on and ask for additional work until you feel you are losing your colleague:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;documentation: add a small description of the functions in the readme, add function documentation in the code, and add some examples in the readme…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;test environment / branch: you will have to test it yourself but if there is a few quickly runnable functions with example data, already present in the code, this is a plus. Even better, can this be automated in a CI/CD environment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a quick and easy way to achieve a good quality pipeline / code / tool for the get-go is to use this template Github environment for any new Python project (I am sure that an R version exists somewhere): &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have mentioned tools quickly and I won’t go into the sterile python/R debate here. Everyone knows Python is best, deep down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the question is what tool should you use to pipeline your code, this is a common need in computational biology and elsewhere. Many tools exist but for computational biology, I haven’t seen much better than:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://terra.bio/&quot;&gt;Terra&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;- the easiest one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nf-co.re/&quot;&gt;Nextflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bio.tools/snakemake&quot;&gt;Snakemake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://airflow.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Airflow&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;- the most generalist one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are not in order of awesomeness but in order of ease of use for newbies and of how generalistic they are. Honestly, I would always advise starting with Terra and continuing with something like NetFlow or airflow once this is not suiting your need anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are thousands: https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline
… but these ones are key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, whatever language/tool you use, you will have to know that they are actually mostly following the same logic and doing the same thing. And overall, one tool that will be inevitable to know how to use is &lt;strong&gt;docker&lt;/strong&gt;. 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the introduction to this lesson’s learned blog post, I mentioned Occam’s razor Occam’s razor 🪒. It is something that I kept thinking about during the time I handled the depmap-omics pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But behind this curse what you ought to think about are things like. How do we prevent the most bugs? 🐛 How do we onboard new people? How do we make it reproducible for external and internal users? etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some, many of the rules / lessons I will mention here will be basic engineering and good practices. Then maybe what will interest you is what I didn’t mention. I leave you to comment if you think these omissions were important or not. 📝&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jérémie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="BroadInstitute" /><category term="Big Data" /><category term="genomics" /><category term="Python" /><summary type="html">If you are working in data-sciences / genomics and on large-scale projects: This post might be of interest to you.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2 years at the Broad Institute</title><link href="https://jkobject.com/blog/two-years-at-the-broad/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2 years at the Broad Institute" /><published>2021-06-11T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-06-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://jkobject.com/blog/two-years-at-the-broad</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jkobject.com/blog/two-years-at-the-broad/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-years-at-the-broad-institute&quot;&gt;2 years at the Broad Institute&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last year was tough. Much tougher for some than others. Here I want to speak about the 2nd year at the Broad and what life was like during this pandemic. 😷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ccle-part&quot;&gt;CCLE part&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Broad continued functioning as fast as ever despite this pandemic. My work was still divided into two groups and research focus. Let’s look at the CCLE, also called depmap-omics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;making-ccle-into-a-real-pipeline&quot;&gt;Making CCLE into a real pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past year, I managed to convince most of the team to put a lot of effort into making CCLE into a real pipeline. This is something that appeared to me like a very important issue since I was working on the pipeline (see previous CCLE articles: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/blog/one-year-at-the-broad/&quot;&gt;one-year-at-the-broad&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/projects/depmap-omics-howto/&quot;&gt;depmap-omics-howto&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort involved doing 4 separate tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding all our data (bam files) across broad servers and Terra buckets. &lt;em&gt;This allowed us to realize we were missing a lot of input data for our output data.&lt;/em&gt; :eyeglasses:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating an MVP database with all available metadata. &lt;em&gt;This allowed us to realize many missannotation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rewriting things into a coherent one command pipeline. &lt;em&gt;This allowed us to find errors in the code and to remove useless blocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run the entire pipeline at every release (using call caching when possible).As, before the code was only run on new samples and the output appended to the full dataset (itself likely processed with different versions of the code). &lt;em&gt;This was truly key in uncovering big mistakes in the code that were not caught before.&lt;/em&gt; ➿&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 more were also key in figuring out issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making cross dataset QCs, spearheaded by James McFarland. ⛔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making SNP fingerprinting QCs on our input data, spearheaded by William&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;issues-in-the-pipeline&quot;&gt;Issues in the pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the issues we discovered in our data and our code were found at the worst of time, during releases. With multiple ongoing projects, a very long pipeline, the only time I had to work on the pipeline was within releases. Because of that, it was very difficult to neatly separate my work into dev/prod branches. I basically only had the time to do 2 out of 3 key things: 1.improve the prod, 2.test it and 3.run it. ⏲️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, after a year of asking for more involvement in this pipeline, it is finally thanks to a couple big “in release” issues that management woke up to this need. We then quickly got the manpower to work on some of the key improvements needed for this pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-next-for-productionalization-of-depmap-omics&quot;&gt;What is next for productionalization of depmap omics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have a couple more things in our list of improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making a true DB: a work spearheaded by Phil Montgommery to create an SQL database that would interface with multiple google sheets, python, google cloud and run a set of tests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improving our data onboarding process: Getting data from the sequencing facility and matching it with what we have and the metadata from other groups is still a complex process that needs to be improved. This work is also spearheaded by Phil and could come as part of the DB. 🗳️&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;moving away from the CGA mutation calling pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improving QCs: we generate many QC files as part of our analysis pipeline. Parsing and aggregating this into coherent metrics would be very useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increasing the documentation: for the folder structure, for the functions used and how to use the depmapomics github project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;simplifying code tests, using pytests and continuous development tools and good practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that a new goal: “sequencing 10x more data/ cell lines in the coming years” has been set, they will become necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;figuring-out-new-features-to-extract&quot;&gt;Figuring out new features to extract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on depmap-omics was not only about making the things we already had better. But also creating new tools to extract more features from our sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created with Javad an up-to-date &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d0dpGI1Ur0KXy9l-YbXzWV6d0CK7htrtNKp-lSSh-Is&quot;&gt;list of features to extract&lt;/a&gt; that we will want to be extracted from our sequencing in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this can be used as an extensive list of what can be done with WG/WE/RNA -seq data. :blue_book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to start working on some of them in the last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;getting WGS CN&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;getting Y chromosome WGS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making SV calls on WES and WGS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making “germline” mutation calling (SNP, indels) on our cell line for WGS and WES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of them were used and QCed by multiple groups at the Broad, often leading to new research. (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Misek et. al.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-manager&quot;&gt;Changing manager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like since I arrived, CCLE was always in a transition period. The manager had just left and his associate too. An interim from another manager was held while we looked for a more permanent manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also changed ops team twice, which meant that twice in two years we reviewed, changed, and made errors because of team onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this was a true issue as responsibilities were not held and there was no maintained vision for what would be the future of depmap and depmap-omics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, this vision was maintained by the people that were there since the beginning, even though they are not directly participating in the project. During this second year at the Broad I have spent more than a semester being the main responsible and objective tracking person for the depmap omics pipeline. The data, code, future objectives, management and responsibilities were on me while we waited for the new ops team, new associates and new manager to arrive and get onboarded. :adhesive_bandage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I think I liked this part. It allowed me to manage this project on my own and learn project management skills that I might not have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately my role was not meant for it. And I was not able (as described above) to express the needs of the project or be heard in potential issues. Every decision was done reactively once something went way too bad and not proactively following my recommandation. This was my main source of frustration during the last year on CCLE. 🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;celligner&quot;&gt;Celligner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has now been 2 months that my focus has changed from CCLE to a new project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20294-x&quot;&gt;Celligner&lt;/a&gt;. This project was initiated by Allie Warren. 💯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to stay for a third year at the Broad to work on improving Celligner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The axes of improvements are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Usability (interactive platform, open sourcing, documentation…)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aggregation of more data types (other sample type, other sequencing,…)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Algorithm improvement (using VAEs, decreasing memory load…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of work then, many papers to read and even more ideas. Let’s see what we get out of this. 💭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amlproject-part&quot;&gt;AMLproject part&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my second year in the AMLproject, I have done many more analyses but also had to wrap up what I had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;slam-seq-with-spike-in&quot;&gt;Slam-seq with spike-in&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the endeavours I had to work on was analysing a data type that had not been produced before. A slam-seq experiment, which is RNA-sequencing where the nascent RNAs are labelled such that all their T nucleotides are transformed into C nucleotides. This forced mutation can be used to differentiate gene expression into transcript being produced currently and transcript produced before. ⏲️ This is to answer the question: are there more transcripts being produced now because of some condition we put the cell in (and differentiate it from secondary effects of co-regulation). 📶 🛑&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was already done before &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/800&quot;&gt;Muhar et. al.&lt;/a&gt;. However we had added spike-in to the mix. This allows us to differentiate absolute amounts of DNA in sample X vs sample Y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of my work was figuring out how to analyse and use Slam-seq data with spike-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chipmerger&quot;&gt;chipMerger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t go in the details of the cobinding matrix (which is already explained in the previous documents (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/projects/predicting-dependencies-from-enhancers/&quot;&gt;predicting-dependencies-from-enhancers&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com//blog/one-year-at-the-broad/&quot;&gt;one-year-at-the-broad&lt;/a&gt;). We quickly realized that we had to do better with our input ChIP-seq data in order to gain better results 💹. We devised an idea, with Max, to take ChIPseq bed and bigwig files and merge them together, then try to find new peaks under the replicate bigwigs where those peaks were not initially found, using a lower detection threshold than what MACS2 was using. This led to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/broadinstitute/genepy/blob/master/genepy/epigenetics/CREME.md&quot;&gt;CREME algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wrapping-up-amlproject&quot;&gt;wrapping up AMLproject&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In research, wrapping up a project means,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting up enough documentation for other people to take on your work and publishing your code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;writing a paper. :book:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;selecting, improving and commenting figures for your paper. 📈&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;writing the method’s section of the paper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;publishing and documenting your output data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting up server (SRA, google cloud, spreadsheets..) to publish your input data, QC and processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I also spent the last year doing. I also quickly set up a resource website for showing off some interactive plot and easy access to our data. In the meantime I also helped another Associate, Monika, to take on my pipelines and codes in order to continue the research endeavour :microscope: of Maxim Pimkin and Stew Orkin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-pandemic&quot;&gt;the pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being away from my family, friends and girlfriend (all living in France), this pandemic was very stressful. After a month of being remote and witnessing border shut downs, 👮‍♂️ I decided to take one of the last planes between the US and europe in order to come to a lock downed Paris to stay with my girlfriend. At that time the Broad was already fully remote and every computational work was maintaining its speed. However, everything else was unknown. How long? How bad? What’s next? This situation continued for 4 month. At that time, I had realized the US had shut its border to any non citizen, even valid visa holders, that had been in the EU less than 14 days prior. 🤦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would wait for this policy to end. But by July, with the first wave of the pandemic being over and almost no cases in the EU, direct entry was still banned for me and everyone I knew. Then started a tiring, stressful, expansive but awesome journey through Yucatan’s and its wonders while still working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a European expat 🇪🇺 in the US during this pandemic was extremely tough. The Broad had a no tolerance policy that required me to either lie to everyone in my company whenever I went to see my family or take 2 weeks of unpaid leave for each trip to the EU. In a competitive environment like the Broad, where 4 weeks a year of vacation is a luxury, better say that there was no real choice. In the last year and a half of the pandemic I went back to France 3 times. Always waiting until it became unbearable, then staying long in France still working and then taking 2 weeks (still working) in Istanbul or Cancun before finally making it to the US. Working from France is also tough as my work day was from 1pm to midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people around me told me to quit. Many insulted the US, my company, my boss, the pandemic, for what it put me through. What it put us through. I still feel I can’t complain too much in the midst of what Covid did to so many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;awards&quot;&gt;Awards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy to note that thanks to (and also despite) all of this, I received a Broad Spotlight award 🤴 and was promoted to ACB II ✨ (which is at least twice as good a position as ACB I 😂).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jérémie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="BroadInstitute" /><category term="Computational Biology" /><category term="Data Science" /><category term="Associate Computational Biologist" /><summary type="html">Short stories about my professional experiences.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A look at Cobinding Analysis</title><link href="https://jkobject.com/blog/cds-presentation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A look at Cobinding Analysis" /><published>2021-01-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-01-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://jkobject.com/blog/cds-presentation</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jkobject.com/blog/cds-presentation/"></content><author><name>Jérémie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="BroadInstitute" /><category term="AML" /><category term="Cancer" /><category term="Broad" /><category term="Epigenetics" /><summary type="html">A look at my cobinding analysis as part of my research on the epigenetics of AML dependencies</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A year at the Broad Institute</title><link href="https://jkobject.com/blog/one-year-at-the-broad/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A year at the Broad Institute" /><published>2020-06-11T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-06-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://jkobject.com/blog/one-year-at-the-broad</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jkobject.com/blog/one-year-at-the-broad/">&lt;p&gt;I have to say that when I had planned this article, I was not expecting the craziness of the next 6 months.
I have now spent 1.5 years at the Broad. But 6 of them have actually been remote and back in France. I now expect to spend the entirety of this second year, remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thus going to talk about the first non-remote, pre-Covid year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finishing-onboarding&quot;&gt;Finishing onboarding.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was warned that the onboarding might last a couple of months. Being a foreigner did not help and I can finally say that now, a year later, I feel fully onboarded to the Broad and the Cambridge way of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cambridge way of life often implies, amongst other things: Grocery shopping at union square market, getting a couple of doughnuts at Union square doughnuts. drinking fancy beers at remnant, lamplighter or  . Asking people if they are doing a post-doc or a phd the first time you meet. Getting your baguette at Tate and enjoying the many ice creams cambridge has to offer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What takes so long. Well except getting up to speed with the lab’s specific softwares and technologies. Getting a sense of the myriads of projects ✨ and collaborations happening around you. its getting to know the history of projects that came before you, reason for things. &lt;strong&gt;It’s getting to know power dynamics!&lt;/strong&gt; 💖 It is soo important to know the power dynamics. I really feel that this is when you know you are on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when you know you have been onboarded. When you know what actions you can do andd what actions you can’t. Then you know how to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least. Once you get your routine. Waiting for the CC&amp;amp;E meetings (cell circuitry and epigenomics), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKD1ScU_XJs&amp;amp;list=PLlMMtlgw6qNjROoMNTBQjAcdx53kV50cS&quot;&gt;MIA talks&lt;/a&gt; (models, inference and algorithms) 👍.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are onboarded this is also when you start getting ideas for projects you could launch and whom to collaborate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-have-done&quot;&gt;What I have done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this year I have been able to present papers and lead team meetings.
I have been able to present my research during the yearly Broad research conference.
A 3000 people event gathering all imaginable research in molecular biology 🤯.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also able to interact with many teams across the broad for small projects. helping them solve issues or helping me to solve issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know from other posts: &lt;em&gt;see &lt;a href=&quot;https://jkobject.com/projects/predicting-dependencies-from-enhancers/&quot;&gt;AML project&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jkobject.com/projects/depmap-omics-howto/&quot;&gt;depmap omics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  I am the principal bio-informaticist of two main projects. One at the Broad and one at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was also able to have a smaller participation in some side projects (side projects for me :wink:) regarding specific cancer dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diversity-of-projects&quot;&gt;Diversity of Projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them was focused on the WRN dependency in MSI cancers. see &lt;a href=&quot;https://jkobject.com/projects/wrn-dependencies/&quot;&gt;wrn dependencies&lt;/a&gt;, and one was on the VPS4A dependency in VPS4B deficient cancers. see &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;vps4a dependency&lt;/a&gt;. These projects were driven primarily by biologists and experimentalists. They came to us because they needed some additional computational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the goal fo the projects understood, this was “fairly trivial” analysis, wrapped up in less than 2 weeks. What takes 90% of my time are the two main projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first 8 months of my time I was also involved in revamping &lt;a href=&quot;https://cellfactory.broadinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;CCLF&lt;/a&gt;’s computational pipeline. I also layed down a first SOP and road-map for the data processing and release 💪.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ccle&quot;&gt;CCLE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For CCLE, a set of circumstances made it so that I ended up being the only computationalist on the project during a period of 10 months. Hopefully Neekesh Dharia, my mentor at the time was able to provide the biology intuition in all of that. I went on to maintain, QC and productionalize the pipeline. My main focus was on the reproducibility. It quickly appeared that none of what we were producing could be reproduced by anyone. Even ourselves. We had to work with many people from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gtexportal.org/home/&quot;&gt;GtEX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cancer-genome-computational-analysis&quot;&gt;CGA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/data-sciences-platform&quot;&gt;DSP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/reading-and-editing-biology/genomics-platform&quot;&gt;GP&lt;/a&gt;.. At the end, I layed down a plan taking from everything We have learnt along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ccle-main-issues&quot;&gt;CCLE: Main Issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two major issues faced in our work now has been on the data sharing process. Even cell lines, released at this scale, need to have a regulatory framework built around them. issues are mostly around pseudo-somatic[1] and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline_mutation&quot;&gt;germline&lt;/a&gt; mutations and which ones can be released to whom, and how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one is mainly regarding the size of the project. This is project is between a large science experiment and a fully fledged product. The amount of users that we have and the sensitivity of their projects make any of our changes have big consequences downstream for a lot of human cancer research*. 😑&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entails that any changes we want to make need to be carefully reviewed and thought about. This makes for a lot of frustrations. Things can be slow. Mistakes &amp;amp; non optimal decisions can live on for much longer because the effort needed to change them become very high. ⬆️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* &lt;em&gt;I think that we all take this pressure, at depmap, fairly well. This drives us to put the best of ourselves while still being ok with our mistakes. We know that everyone makes mistakes and that the state of genetic cancer research and computational biology as a whole, does not reach anyone’s expectations, yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ccle-what-is-to-come&quot;&gt;CCLE: What is to come&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the main objectives are still works in progress. We are in the work of hiring a new ACB to take on most of the workload around improving, productionalizing and running the pipeline itself. :construction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, we have recently switched to WGS -whole genome- data which required us to rethink the flow data architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main focus ↘️ for the coming month will be to have it in a good state of documentation and to have clearly layed down SOPs and directions of improvements for the new ACB -entry level computational biologist-.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also soon start to focus full time on a machine learning project (undisclosed for now), related to CCLE and Dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amlproject&quot;&gt;AMLproject&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are working mainly with very deep sequencing of a handful of cell lines under many different conditions 🌪️. The dynamics are very different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are pursuing a very specific goal 🥅 in understanding a biological phenomena.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are all young scientist learning as we go and doing more cutting edge experiments (and thus, analysis)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reliability and efficiency is really a side goal (until it can’t be).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;many many different types of experiments of various quality exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now almost proved what we need to in order to publish this work in a high tier journal. Maxim Pimkin has really been the master mind 🔦 behind everything related to the biology in this project. His intuition 💭 has led most of our decisions, which also a big difference compared to CCLE. Other very talented people have worked hard on this project. But I like to think of myself as the lead computational biologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aml-main-issues&quot;&gt;AML: Main Issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that is notoriously hard in a project, is to work with low foresight. Here each new experiments would trigger new unforeseen ones. 
In code there is two ways to do things: 🧑‍🏭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iteratively: 1version 2nd version etc.. –&amp;gt; going toward a metric of quality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in one go: you have to build something and you build it block by block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we did the first one, however we never know what the next version would be and we would go as much toward an improved version as toward version with new functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes obviously, time. Each version is also very specific toward one specific thing. Transmitting this information and approach was particularly hard to biologist. They often expect the later. It is also hard to estimate the time things will take. A very similar experiment could run much faster than a slightly different one for example.
A marginal amount of work on a first experiment could save countless hours in the coming ones, etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A very similar experiment could run much faster than a slightly different one for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interacting across disciplines is hard but leads to some of the best projects and we could see some examples here. :sparkles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aml-what-is-to-come&quot;&gt;AML: What is to come&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this project we have discovered many interesting properties of the leukemia regulatory circuitry. We have also discovered interesting features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lexogen.com/slamseq-metabolic-rna-labeling/&quot;&gt;slam-seq&lt;/a&gt; ⏲️. We want it to become an additional side -letter format- paper. Moreover we have left open many biological questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our Main objectives is quite similar to CCLE’s. We need an additional ACB which will learn from me and learn how to use my pipelines. This will also free me from wrapping up some analysis and thinking more about the paper and how to better release the code. 📈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to also try and be able to finish our analysis of large scale &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor&quot;&gt;Transcription factor&lt;/a&gt; co-binding. 🎇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s meet in a month to see how things turned out! :wave:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] I call pseudo-somatic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_mutation&quot;&gt;somatic&lt;/a&gt; mutations in cell lines as they are somewhat more losely defined than somatic in cancer tissues, they regroup immortalizing mutations -due to the process of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortalised_cell_line&quot;&gt;immortalizing a cell line&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5048&quot;&gt;private&lt;/a&gt; snps and cancer mutations that also exist as germlines.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jérémie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="BroadInstitute" /><category term="Computational Biology" /><category term="Data Science" /><category term="Associate Computational Biologist" /><summary type="html">Short stories about my professional experiences.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction</title><link href="https://jkobject.com/blog/umap-explanation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction" /><published>2019-10-13T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-13T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://jkobject.com/blog/umap-explanation</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jkobject.com/blog/umap-explanation/">&lt;p&gt;Umap is a dimensionality reduction algorithm. It takes points defined by vectors of high dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2D vector= (x,y),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3D vector= (x,y,z),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ND vector= (x,y,z,a,b,c,…n)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And puts them back in lower dimensions. This allows for visualizing point clouds in 2D and also finding a subspace/ base / manifold in which the cloud data lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be better seen in the 3D to 2D case. The reduced vector is also called an embedding of the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/dimred.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;scikit learn&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;View of learning the shape of a “sheet of paper” only by knowing a set of points that lie on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other famous techniques (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@raghavan99o/principal-component-analysis-pca-explained-and-implemented-eeab7cb73b72&quot;&gt;PCA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;d&quot;&gt;MDS&lt;/a&gt;…), it learns this structure by using local information. i.e. only looking at specific patches at a time. The neighbors of each points, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@raghavan99o/principal-component-analysis-pca-explained-and-implemented-eeab7cb73b72&quot;&gt;t-SNE&lt;/a&gt;. This type of technique is called non linear as it can learn complex “bendy” shapes (like the S above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neighbor information is better encoded into a graph. With edges representing distances between points. and only displaying the edges to the nearest points in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distance is normalized by all distances this point has to its neighbors, meaning now the range of possible distances is transformed into a [0,1] range where the closest point will be at a distance 0 and the furthest point will be at a distance computed such that summing all the distances between all neighbors will get to $log2(#neibors)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then for all the neighbors we create a set (a list of unique things) for all edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This set will be “fuzzy”, as it also contains a value representing how much each neighbors to a point is in the set of neighbors to this point, based on its distance to the center point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will do this for each point and then merge all the sets created for each point.
Meaning, we will merge the edges and keep only the ones with the lowest distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then take each edges and consider them together as a graph or a skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pausing for a second&lt;/strong&gt;, we can really see that the only thing we have done here is defined edges between points and merging them together. However you have to understand that the same edge in two different set, will have two different distances as they have both been normalized by different sets of neighbors. Thus even a point far away from everything else will get one of its edges in the graph. 
These two edges would get merged by using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/t-conorm&quot;&gt;t-conorm&lt;/a&gt; (which a fuzzy logic way of taking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)&quot;&gt;norm&lt;/a&gt; of something) on their two respective lengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that we are thinking here about graph of nodes and edges but the topological logic could be applied to the faces made by each set of 3 edges and the volumes made by each set of 4 faces, etc … This would complexify the model (and render it impossible to compute) but also make it more closer to the theory underlying it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then take the core components of this graph using &lt;a href=&quot;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_cluster_comparison.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-cluster-comparison-py&quot;&gt;spectral embedding&lt;/a&gt;, where we basically take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&quot;&gt;eigenvector&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix&quot;&gt;matrix of adjacency&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. A square of numbers where rows represent the nodes of the graph and the columns represent the same nodes and the values of the matrix are the distance between, each point)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&quot;&gt;decomposition&lt;/a&gt; of the information into two things: one that define a base for the object to exist in and the other defining the layout of the object. You need both to reconstruct the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we will only take the first 2 most important value of the base and considers it as what defines our object in 2 dimension (but it could be any other number, lower than the initial number of dimension). The two values here are vectors: they represent the 2 dimensions of each points (x,y) and each of their value/dimensions represent each of the different points in our point cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we will try to improve this first version by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization&quot;&gt;minimization&lt;/a&gt; process. There, we want to apply a physical-like force between the nodes so that close connected edges get closer together (up to a minimum distance)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/umap.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;we can see the relation to the number of samples used and the max distance to create graph edges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, there is a theoretical explanation of the algorithm that can be seen in terms of learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic&quot;&gt;fuzzy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_set&quot;&gt;simplicial sets&lt;/a&gt; defining the local structure of the high dimensional data and of the lower dimensional one and making the two sets converge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanation defined in part 2 of the paper can be understood by anyone after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=xbL11KfgiEAC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;hl=fr&amp;amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; which will allow the reader to gain the vocabulary to understand the wikipedia pages defining the vocabulary used in the paper. :p&lt;/p&gt;

I managed to get my Visa 5 hours🕔 before catching my plane and the next➡️ thing you know. I was in an unfurnished apartment, waiting for it all to start.
The  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/blog/broadinstitute-interview/&quot;&gt;Broad Institute&lt;/a&gt; is part of these institute a lot of people have never heard👂 of. Backed by billionaire philanthropist. They do cutting edge research and give their members a dream job. In that regard they compete ➕more➕ with the silicon valley unicorn🦄 than any other company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/broad1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came at the broad and did not do a Ph.D. right now for a reason. In this place I am surrounded by people coming from the best schools🎒 in the US, they are driven and all extremely bright. See, I had never been in such an environment before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/blog/an-internship-in-new-york/&quot;&gt;Flatiron Institute&lt;/a&gt;. But last time.. I loved💝 it and felt I had learnt more in a couple of months than in 2 years at school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to do research, I want to have a Ph.D. I want to become an entrepreneur. I want for people to be free from disease😷 and untimely death💀. But what I know is that in order to do that I need to be surrounded with a  lot of people with a similar mindset and will. This is what I found🔎 in Boston and at the Broad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/advancedstudy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am working on a couple of subjects. I am part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancerdatascience.org/&quot;&gt;CDS&lt;/a&gt;, which work on computational analysis and prediction of Big Biological Dataset in order to better❇️ understand the mechanism of the cell  in the context of human🚶 cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using Machine Learning, Bioinformatic and High Performance Computing in order to tackle a set of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main biological data and technique being used in our group👥 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturb-seq&quot;&gt;Perturbation&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, we perturb a large amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cancer-cell-line&quot;&gt;Cancer Cell Lines&lt;/a&gt; -landmark,ex patient cancerous tissue that has  evolved to live and replicate in petri dish since decades- genes by removing❌ them with Crispr tools🔩, by destroying their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA&quot;&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference&quot;&gt;RNAi&lt;/a&gt;, by submitting the cells to doses of small molecules (drugs and others) and then looking 👀 at their growth📈 rate and sequencing their transcriptome (the quantity of RNA in the cell).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/crisprscreen.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort is seconded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle&quot;&gt;CCLE&lt;/a&gt; which categorizes via many assays and tools🔭, each cancer cell lines〰️. All of it belong to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://depmap.org/&quot;&gt;DepMap Project&lt;/a&gt;, around which a lot (&amp;gt;50) of secondary project gravitate. these projects are made in partnership with research lab at Harvard and MIT and with hospitals in Boston, such as the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, MGH and Boston Children’s hospital🏥. But also with companies such as Novartis and Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been tasked in taking care of the data💽 processing aspect of CCLE. with each new Cell Line release I will assay a lot of its genetic informationℹ️ and output it for a quarterly🌗 releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/depmapmodel.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second work has to do with the analysis of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenomics&quot;&gt;epigenome&lt;/a&gt;. Which is a set of features on the DNA that can be analyzed and used to understand how the cell is reading📖 and processing DNA at the time of analysis. this can help inferring the program of the cell and differentiate it to any other cells in our body -which all have the same DNA sequence, however not the same function.-
In this epigenome I look👀 at networks of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network&quot;&gt;regulatory processes&lt;/a&gt; which involving &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhancer_(genetics)&quot;&gt;enhancers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor&quot;&gt;transcription factors&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them create a feed forward process called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772020/&quot;&gt;Core Regulatory circuitry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to understand and analyze it in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/patient/adult-aml-treatment-pdq&quot;&gt;Acute Myeloid Leukemia&lt;/a&gt; in children👶. Understanding it might help in inferring the global cellular program and thus the possible actions that can be undertaken to disrupt or reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadies as we are called  enjoy, in addition➕ to a life goal, an extremely decent salaries, food 🍦 everywhere (or maybe it is just the US) and talks🗨 twice per day. I know.. I am spoiled.&lt;/p&gt;
