&lt;p&gt;There I spent four days with many PIs and around twice as much students 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 all over the world interested in computational biology🧪 . Each of them were extremely bright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lausanne is this unique place at the center of Europe where you feel a similar atmosphere of entrepreneurship and enthusiasm and research as one would in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4096/1*Wll-nX_BACKgSLOxL07XvQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I had the chance to meet with many great researchers such as Pr. Naef working on answering fundamental questions on cellular rhythms. 
Pr. La &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lwsjpbMAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Manno&lt;/a&gt; who tries to understand the dynamics of cellular differentiation through methods of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0414-6&quot;&gt;RNA velocity&lt;/a&gt;. 
Pr. Rahi which tries to model the dynamical interaction of interaction networks in cells. 
Pr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H7Y-wqQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Barth&lt;/a&gt; which is using knowledge in protein conformation to membrane receptors applying it to cancer research and immunotherapies. 
Pr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bXoXq2AAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Manley&lt;/a&gt;, which is using methods of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-r%C3%A9solution&quot;&gt;super-resolution&lt;/a&gt; microscopy to see more about cells and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual most of them were initially trained physicists. Each of them had specific projects using machine learning which I have been able to relate to a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*gS6bJpTt8t-UpcHm3fI8Xg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had the chance to present my past research projects (that you can find on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jkobject.com&quot;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;) and which slides are available online: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.slideshare.net/jkalfon/epfl-edcb-phd-candidate-presentation&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It seems that the researchers had a good interest in me and my background which made me very proud and enthusiastic. 
Moreover I love skiing🎿 and Lausanne is 45mns away from “les pistes”. (Which is a nice 👍 added bonus right?).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jérémie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="hirings" /><category term="Computational Biology" /><category term="PhD" /><category term="Job Interview" /><category term="Epfl" /><category term="Research" /><summary type="html">During the last week of January I had the chance to enter the hiring program of EPFL’s edcb program.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Boston Interviews</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/broadinstitute-interview/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Boston Interviews" /><published>2019-01-20T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-01-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/broadinstitute-interview</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/broadinstitute-interview/">&lt;p&gt;I have had the chance to fly to Boston in the last week of January to spend a day at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;Broad institute&lt;/a&gt; of MIT and Harvard. There I met with parts of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancerdatascience.org/&quot;&gt;cancer data science&lt;/a&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KnCyEE2rRoQf7xp0w76vtQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their goal is mainly to understand cancer and find new therapies by using techniques of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference&quot;&gt;RNAi screening&lt;/a&gt; / CRISPR-CAS9 screen which knocks out genes 🧬 the cell. They can then record the new cellular activity. Similarly with drugs screening. A lot of computational tools 🛠 to be designed to infer the reasons and actions of such screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the chance to meet with Pr. Vasquez, Pr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5WP7REMAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Tsherniak&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eNuF408AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Dahria&lt;/a&gt;, Dr &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1SW8lOgAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;pimkin&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IUbpwKoAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Joshua&lt;/a&gt; Dempster, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jrm2Cr8AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; McFarland, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6O0QvksAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Guillaume&lt;/a&gt; kugener, Mustafa Kocak, Phil Montgomery and Jadwiga Grabarek. All very nice and brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This day was intense and I only had 28hrs in Boston. The stress was obviously 🙄 high and white board questions made me feel as incompetent and stupid as they should have. However it was an amazing experience. The Broad Institute is amazing and so was Boston. I only had the chance to walk across the river, glide on the frozen water of the Boston public garden and get a humongous shake shack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting was part of my ongoing effort to find my next research environment in Computational Biology🧪. Here the position is a job of two years as an associate computational biologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew England pretty well now but never visited Cambridge. We were hosted in a magnificent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gonvillehotel.co.uk/&quot;&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt;,🏨 in front of one of Cambridge’s college. Most of the aspiring Ph.D. students there were very bright and knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is mixed with the Springer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wellcomegenomecampus.org/&quot;&gt;welcome genome campus&lt;/a&gt; and span many designer, 👩‍🎨 buildings. In summer at least it felt very beautiful and lively. The researchers were in group made cubicles which would not be, to me, the best way to let people interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/8064/1*hjG7G9efRKvLrUJMputQYQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent 3 days in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One for first introductions and a very stressful interview with many PIs at the same time, filled with tricky questions. We then finished the day going to a bar and having some “proper diner”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One with lab, 🔬 visits and a final presentation of round of questions from every PIs again. The evening was fabulous, going to one of Cambridge’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/kcuPNYx35o62&quot;&gt;oldest college&lt;/a&gt; and having the fanciest diner in a reception room, discussing with all PIs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We spent the last day with final lab visits and group selection. We then went on to visit the city, 🌃 and do canoe, 🛶 on Cambridge’s river.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not accepted there, it was probably for the better as the coming month would be filled with amazing projects and news that would not have even matched this magnificent city.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jérémie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="hirings" /><category term="Cambridge" /><category term="PhD" /><category term="Job Interview" /><category term="Research" /><summary type="html">A few months ago, I went to Cambridge, UK, 🇬🇧 to participate to hiring days and interview for EMBL-EBI</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">An MSc at the University of Kent</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/an-msc-at-the-univeristy-of-kent/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An MSc at the University of Kent" /><published>2017-09-20T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-09-20T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/an-msc-at-the-univeristy-of-kent</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/an-msc-at-the-univeristy-of-kent/">&lt;p&gt;I recently came back from a graduation, 🎓 day in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury&quot;&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, England. There, I have received in the most sumptuous Cathedral, a Master of Science in Advanced Computer Science, 🧪 and Computational Intelligence with Distinction from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kent.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;University of Kent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XpaYaPvxAq_Ax_HM2MIv7Q.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
I had a lot of choice of destinations to do a double degree arrangement during my last years at ECE. I decided to choose this one as it seemed to me the best opportunity to both enter the academical system, get a degree from an english speaking country and learn about machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I went to live on the campus in what I found to be a gigantic university. My room was 10sq meters large and with only a small window showing an empty field. I cried for 10mn straight when I arrived. Coming back from a crazy internship, some conferences in Lausanne and a life in Paris… it was different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I knew that everything was in my head and that if I would to put things in order and create a nice environment, I may be happy, 😃. There I put the distraction away, far away and I was left with myself and a will to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took courses and even 2 additional ones (out of curiosity). I got books, 📖 at the library and set in order a daily planning that filled my day entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mcBt1Ie1L0RmI4SoXWUrtQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had one, ☝️ plan. To produce an amazing master thesis, to learn as much as I could and to find the best possible Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy it was nice, 👍 . My girlfriend, at the time, was living in London and I cam every 2 weekends to see her and spend time in the city. I was not envying her as I discover the peacefulness of Kent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*A7o8iHrsDiSkIGS5lA62gA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efforts were worth it and I would never do things differently, I discovered the British way of life with its Wittabix, pubs, 8 pints, 🍻🍺 a night, its porridges and brunches.&lt;/p&gt;

I am part of this international research group thanks to my involvement in the 2017 Young Researcher Event and 2017 Researcher Event respectively in Geneva and Lausanne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the European project to gather data, models and tools 🧰 around a unique platform and alleviate the power a supercomputer across Europe. It is designed to give researchers interested in the field, information on how to use some parts of the platform and how to create collaboration to run 🏃‍♀️ and share their data and results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events I attended to were designed to showcase some researchers work on the platform and to let us learn the tools together with the researchers that designed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-involvement&quot;&gt;My Involvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*nGM0RHDgzpZ3HrCc4ZSKWw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the course of 4 days, I have focused my interest mainly on the NeuroMorphic Platform and the NeuroBotic Platform. The first one, ☝️ is a platform which regroups two supercomputers with radically new and different designs. The first one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiNNaker&quot;&gt;SpiNNaker&lt;/a&gt; is based in Manchester and the second one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://brainscales.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/&quot;&gt;BrainscaleS&lt;/a&gt; is based in Heideberg. In different they are creating new chip design to allow for ultra fast, large scale brain simulation. I gained now the ability to connect and run simulation on those computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NRP is a simulation interface using &lt;a href=&quot;http://gazebosim.org/&quot;&gt;gazebo&lt;/a&gt; that allows to simulate any physical environment and integrate any physical objects : houses, 🏠 , tables, balls, 🎾 , rats, 🐀 , robots, etc..
It allows for many ways to connect your simulated animals/robots to the HBP supercomputers -making it controllable by spiking neural networks- or any other scripts and Machine Learning interfaces. Removing the need to test complex Neural Networks on &lt;a href=&quot;http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/&quot;&gt;MNIST&lt;/a&gt; data or having to create robots, 🤖 to test it. It transforms a tedious process of creating the robots, developing the right controls and uploading/connecting the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

You can find out more about the work I did there in the Center for Computational Biology, 🧪, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jkobject.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I fell in love, with New York. But that can be understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading, 📖 a lot about the work of some Professors. I then spent many month reaching out to any of them, learning in the process the best introduction, documents etc.. Many of them were not interested but still gave a lot of relevant feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reasons I got accepted to work as a research associate in the team of &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=7Bgb5TUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Mytia&lt;/a&gt; chklovskii. This was an amazing opportunity for which I will always be thankful to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6000/1*vV0FxD2lblmeEmbU8WS6Rg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my amazement have not stopped here. The salary given in the contract was otherworldly. 5 times as much as the best internship contract given to my fellow schoolmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flatiron was on thee 5th avenue and I would be freely hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyu.edu/&quot;&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt; on Washington square. Due to unavailability of the room I however, had to spend a couple of weeks at a luxurious &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therogernewyork.com/&quot;&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt;, 🏨 .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a New Yorker’s life as it should be! Damn my standards just had a refresh and my friends now hated me. The lunch, 🥙 could be ordered from anywhere in Manhattan, each month had its team day. Each week had its lab cocktail, 🍸 .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XJ43R8loZLE7Ru1NzW3MFw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place was amazing but most amazingly I had the chance to eat with &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Simons&quot;&gt;Jim&lt;/a&gt; Simons and discuss about my projects and life goals and get some very good advices. The culmination fo chance, my girlfriend found at the same time an internship in New York’s french embassy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A morning routine would be to go running, 🏃‍♀️ through washsqua, to NYU’s gym, work out, 🏋️‍♀️ , go get a free Starbucks cold brew, take a shower, 🚿 , dress up and skate up to the institue on the 5th avenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*XTzaJuYPBQHRSKrg0vliMA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening was often spent in a restaurant or exploring the city. Friends, 👫 and Family came visit me and it might have been the best days of my short existence. The flatiron can be sure they will hear from me again, with two more Masters and a Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a biomedical startup which aims to implement semi biologic mitral valve through the femoral vein. Transforming complex open heart,💓 surgery into a simple ambulatory surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Oo-0K6T83Ixo8mHE.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, mitral valve insufficiency is a really commons old age disease which affects people in a spectacular way weakening every part of their body ( the typically weak old person ).
A way of treating such a problem dates from the 80s where artificial valve where placed inside of the heart through a complex open heart surgery. Such device required patients to be in a good shape -which is rarely the case- and to take anti clotting drugs for the rest of their lives.
 You can find more bout HighLife on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highlifemedical.com/&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HighLife has developed a valve made from pig tissue, cotton fabric and nitinol alloy structure. This allows the valve to be malleable at low temperature an to open up inside the patient’s anatomy. the valve is maintained in place thanks , 🙏 to an elastic placed around the anatomical ropes that links the valve to the bottom of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a group of only three people, HighLife has grown to 13 associates in France, 🇫🇷 and in California.
As it was a small startup I was able to meet with people from very diverse backgrounds such as biomedical engineer, material engineer, manager, heart surgeon, 👩‍⚕️ , doctors …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HighLife Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement Procedure from Malek &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came at a point were Highlife was at the same time, testing its V1.2 valve, creating the V2 valve and delivery, 📦 system as well as beginning clinical trials of the V1 valve.
It was a crucial moment where I had a lot to do but mainly a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-involvement&quot;&gt;My Involvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work there consisted on two things mainly. trying to develop a new Loop Placement Catheter, to deliver the elastic, that would not harm the human being. From this simple task I would need to create prototypes and simulation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solidworks.com&quot;&gt;Solidworks&lt;/a&gt; to find something that would be able to achieve the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3072/1*cpnsFeJRMyQPGRn5io2cIg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;first trial&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;first trial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a prototype where you can see the first demonstration concept on the lower images finally made it through the meticulous verification of the Highlife team. Which they are now using for the V2 LPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that I would need to dive into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appshopper.com/mac/medical/fluoroct&quot;&gt;FluoroCT&lt;/a&gt; software from which you can see a screen, 📺 shot on the previous image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this software I was able to screen different patient’s anatomy and to simulate the curvature and tensions applied to the Valve Delivery Cather and compare it to what knowledge we had gained in animal , 🦓 vivo tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A contrario to the upper video presenting the V1, the V2 VDC follows the same path than the LPC that you can see at the beginning of the video. I was one more time glad to hear just recently that the catheter behaved exactly as planned during the first anatomical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city, 🌃 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/v1AqC4zcLtF2&quot;&gt;Queretaro&lt;/a&gt; of the eponym region is placed in the center of Mexico and tops a 2000m plateau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I studied computer, 💻 science, design and statistics at the Tec de Monterey. We lived at 5 students (unfortunately all French friends in a big house, 🏠 in the UNESCO heritage city center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be lying, to say the least, to say we worked hard during this time. My 6 month stay was filled with trips across Mexico, night out in the city, tasting amazing foods and drinks, 🍸 .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/4og8n1qw7oz&quot;&gt;Teotihuacan&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico DF, &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/nwVbFpmk5o32&quot;&gt;Puerto Escondito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/a82ZTsA2a9S2&quot;&gt;Puerto Vallarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/LKFnHVtVuu92&quot;&gt;Morelia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/vQhWoMSQoXL2&quot;&gt;Xochimilco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/WcNqvCZuT5P2&quot;&gt;Tolantongo&lt;/a&gt;, S&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/dGKj1H7XnqK2&quot;&gt;an Miguel de Allende&lt;/a&gt;, G&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/WcbdikdDZXN2&quot;&gt;uadalajara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/tjaebNC9jFM2&quot;&gt;Xilitla&lt;/a&gt;, S&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/mieBkTBGePt&quot;&gt;an Luis de Potosi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/9XEWGxYsr132&quot;&gt;Tequila&lt;/a&gt; and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I had a tons of fun but also tons of problems. I was alone and could only count on myself. It taught me a lot. Things that cannot really be taught otherwise as I could not even translate it into words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think, 💭 it is going back from Mexico that I really became an adult. This experience was formative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I really miss it now !&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jérémie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="education" /><category term="Mexico" /><category term="Travel" /><category term="Study Abroad" /><category term="Life Experience" /><summary type="html">During my third year of undergraduate studies, I went on to do a semester exchange in Mexico.🇲🇽</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A French Engineering School</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/a-french-engineering-school/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A French Engineering School" /><published>2013-08-03T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-08-03T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/a-french-engineering-school</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/a-french-engineering-school/">&lt;p&gt;It has now been six months since I officially finished my Engineering school, 🏫 I just received my diploma of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.janson-de-sailly.fr/&quot;&gt;HighSchool&lt;/a&gt;, not knowing exactly what I should do to become like my heros: famous entrepreneurs and researchers, I set out to pass a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.concoursavenir.fr/&quot;&gt;concours&lt;/a&gt;“ in order to enter a list of french engineering school that accepts students just after they finish highschool and integrate a preparatory school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*FnZR2lyUlB7lqriEr2x3AA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The french system of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandes_%C3%A9coles&quot;&gt;Grandes Écoles&lt;/a&gt; is complex and quite specific to France, 🇫🇷 : The best french students would enter a preparatory school at the end of their secondary education (which is often still within a highschool) and work for 2 to 3 years to prepare for the “concour” to integrate French Grandes Ecoles. Each School only has a couple hundreds places per yer and tens of thousands of students enter an intellectual fight to integrate the best schools and be immediately rewarded with a bright future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However great, 👍 and exciting this might seem. It is also frightening and often leads to psychological despair, 😩 and a selection of a certain type of student, 👩‍🎓 . Knowing this type of environment might not be for me and not willing to take any risks I decided to pass a first “concour” before and managed to get the best school in it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ece.fr/ecole-ingenieur/&quot;&gt;ECE paris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*I2mjypLLHp6wlY_ocRa_wA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proud of my achievement I entered this school and its preparatory school, knowing that I only had to pass my exams to get a degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot then is similar to what exists in other British schooling systems countries. We may work more with an avg. of 35h of class per week but we have also loads of events, funs etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A French Diploma of Engineering is similar to getting both an M.Sc., M.eng and B.Sc. at the same time and in a more diverse set of disciplines than what is available in other British schooling systems. However students are not well prepared for academia and do not have deep specific knowledge in a define subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ECE students had to choose a Major and a Minor in their 4th year, to do 2 international exchanges and 4 internships, to be able to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thus went to Mexico, 🇲🇽 , England, did internships in Bouygues Construction, HighLife Med, the Flatiron Institute and the University of Kent (you can know more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jkobject.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I choose to major in Biomedical Engineering and choose Research Engineer as a minor.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jérémie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="education" /><category term="Education" /><category term="Carrier" /><category term="France" /><category term="Engineer" /><category term="Prepa" /><summary type="html">It has now been six months since I officially finished my Engineering school, 🏫 I just received my diploma of Engineering.</summary></entry></feed>
