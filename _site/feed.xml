I have now spent 1.5 years at the Broad. But 6 of them have actually been remote and back in France. I now expect to spend the entirety of this second year, remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thus going to talk about the first non-remote, pre-Covid year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finishing-onboarding&quot;&gt;Finishing onboarding.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was warned that the onboarding might last a couple of months. Being a foreigner did not help and I can finally say that now, a year later, I feel fully onboarded to the Broad and the Cambridge way of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cambridge way of life often implies, amongst other things: Grocery shopping at union square market, getting a couple of doughnuts at Union square doughnuts. drinking fancy beers at remnant, lamplighter or  . Asking people if they are doing a post-doc or a phd the first time you meet. Getting your baguette at Tate and enjoying the many ice creams cambridge has to offer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What takes so long. Well except getting up to speed with the lab‚Äôs specific softwares and technologies. Getting a sense of the myriads of projects ‚ú® and collaborations happening around you. its getting to know the history of projects that came before you, reason for things. &lt;strong&gt;It‚Äôs getting to know power dynamics!&lt;/strong&gt; üíñ It is soo important to know the power dynamics. I really feel that this is when you know you are on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when you know you have been onboarded. When you know what actions you can do andd what actions you can‚Äôt. Then you know how to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least. Once you get your routine. Waiting for the CC&amp;amp;E meetings (cell circuitry and epigenomics), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKD1ScU_XJs&amp;amp;list=PLlMMtlgw6qNjROoMNTBQjAcdx53kV50cS&quot;&gt;MIA talks&lt;/a&gt; (models, inference and algorithms) üëç.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are onboarded this is also when you start getting ideas for projects you could launch and whom to collaborate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-have-done&quot;&gt;What I have done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this year I have been able to present papers and lead team meetings.
I have been able to present my research during the yearly Broad research conference.
A 3000 people event gathering all imaginable research in molecular biology ü§Ø.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also able to interact with many teams across the broad for small projects. helping them solve issues or helping me to solve issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know from other posts: &lt;em&gt;see &lt;a href=&quot;https://jkobject.com/projects/predicting-dependencies-from-enhancers/&quot;&gt;AML project&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jkobject.com/projects/depmap-omics-howto/&quot;&gt;depmap omics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  I am the principal bio-informaticist of two main projects. One at the Broad and one at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was also able to have a smaller participation in some side projects (side projects for me :wink:) regarding specific cancer dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diversity-of-projects&quot;&gt;Diversity of Projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them was focused on the WRN dependency in MSI cancers. see &lt;a href=&quot;https://jkobject.com/projects/wrn-dependencies/&quot;&gt;wrn dependencies&lt;/a&gt;, and one was on the VPS4A dependency in VPS4B deficient cancers. see &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;vps4a dependency&lt;/a&gt;. These projects were driven primarily by biologists and experimentalists. They came to us because they needed some additional computational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the goal fo the projects understood, this was ‚Äúfairly trivial‚Äù analysis, wrapped up in less than 2 weeks. What takes 90% of my time are the two main projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first 8 months of my time I was also involved in revamping &lt;a href=&quot;https://cellfactory.broadinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;CCLF&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs computational pipeline. I also layed down a first SOP and road-map for the data processing and release üí™.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ccle&quot;&gt;CCLE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For CCLE, a set of circumstances made it so that I ended up being the only computationalist on the project during a period of 10 months. Hopefully Neekesh Dharia, my mentor at the time was able to provide the biology intuition in all of that. I went on to maintain, QC and productionalize the pipeline. My main focus was on the reproducibility. It quickly appeared that none of what we were producing could be reproduced by anyone. Even ourselves. We had to work with many people from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gtexportal.org/home/&quot;&gt;GtEX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cancer-genome-computational-analysis&quot;&gt;CGA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/data-sciences-platform&quot;&gt;DSP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/reading-and-editing-biology/genomics-platform&quot;&gt;GP&lt;/a&gt;.. At the end, I layed down a plan taking from everything We have learnt along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ccle-main-issues&quot;&gt;CCLE: Main Issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two major issues faced in our work now has been on the data sharing process. Even cell lines, released at this scale, need to have a regulatory framework built around them. issues are mostly around pseudo-somatic[1] and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline_mutation&quot;&gt;germline&lt;/a&gt; mutations and which ones can be released to whom, and how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one is mainly regarding the size of the project. This is project is between a large science experiment and a fully fledged product. The amount of users that we have and the sensitivity of their projects make any of our changes have big consequences downstream for a lot of human cancer research*. üòë&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entails that any changes we want to make need to be carefully reviewed and thought about. This makes for a lot of frustrations. Things can be slow. Mistakes &amp;amp; non optimal decisions can live on for much longer because the effort needed to change them become very high. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* &lt;em&gt;I think that we all take this pressure, at depmap, fairly well. This drives us to put the best of ourselves while still being ok with our mistakes. We know that everyone makes mistakes and that the state of genetic cancer research and computational biology as a whole, does not reach anyone‚Äôs expectations, yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ccle-what-is-to-come&quot;&gt;CCLE: What is to come&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the main objectives are still works in progress. We are in the work of hiring a new ACB to take on most of the workload around improving, productionalizing and running the pipeline itself. :construction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, we have recently switched to WGS -whole genome- data which required us to rethink the flow data architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main focus ‚ÜòÔ∏è for the coming month will be to have it in a good state of documentation and to have clearly layed down SOPs and directions of improvements for the new ACB -entry level computational biologist-.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also soon start to focus full time on a machine learning project (undisclosed for now), related to CCLE and Dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amlproject&quot;&gt;AMLproject&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are working mainly with very deep sequencing of a handful of cell lines under many different conditions üå™Ô∏è. The dynamics are very different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are pursuing a very specific goal ü•Ö in understanding a biological phenomena.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are all young scientist learning as we go and doing more cutting edge experiments (and thus, analysis)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reliability and efficiency is really a side goal (until it can‚Äôt be).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;many many different types of experiments of various quality exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now almost proved what we need to in order to publish this work in a high tier journal. Maxim Pimkin has really been the master mind üî¶ behind everything related to the biology in this project. His intuition üí≠ has led most of our decisions, which also a big difference compared to CCLE. Other very talented people have worked hard on this project. But I like to think of myself as the lead computational biologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aml-main-issues&quot;&gt;AML: Main Issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that is notoriously hard in a project, is to work with low foresight. Here each new experiments would trigger new unforeseen ones. 
In code there is two ways to do things: üßë‚Äçüè≠&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iteratively: 1version 2nd version etc.. ‚Äì&amp;gt; going toward a metric of quality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in one go: you have to build something and you build it block by block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we did the first one, however we never know what the next version would be and we would go as much toward an improved version as toward version with new functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes obviously, time. Each version is also very specific toward one specific thing. Transmitting this information and approach was particularly hard to biologist. They often expect the later. It is also hard to estimate the time things will take. A very similar experiment could run much faster than a slightly different one for example.
A marginal amount of work on a first experiment could save countless hours in the coming ones, etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A very similar experiment could run much faster than a slightly different one for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interacting across disciplines is hard but leads to some of the best projects and we could see some examples here. :sparkles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aml-what-is-to-come&quot;&gt;AML: What is to come&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this project we have discovered many interesting properties of the leukemia regulatory circuitry. We have also discovered interesting features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lexogen.com/slamseq-metabolic-rna-labeling/&quot;&gt;slam-seq&lt;/a&gt; ‚è≤Ô∏è. We want it to become an additional side -letter format- paper. Moreover we have left open many biological questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our Main objectives is quite similar to CCLE‚Äôs. We need an additional ACB which will learn from me and learn how to use my pipelines. This will also free me from wrapping up some analysis and thinking more about the paper and how to better release the code. üìà&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to also try and be able to finish our analysis of large scale &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor&quot;&gt;Transcription factor&lt;/a&gt; co-binding. üéá&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs meet in a month to see how things turned out! :wave:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] I call pseudo-somatic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_mutation&quot;&gt;somatic&lt;/a&gt; mutations in cell lines as they are somewhat more losely defined than somatic in cancer tissues, they regroup immortalizing mutations -due to the process of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortalised_cell_line&quot;&gt;immortalizing a cell line&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5048&quot;&gt;private&lt;/a&gt; snps and cancer mutations that also exist as germlines.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>J√©r√©mie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="BroadInstitute" /><category term="Computational Biology" /><category term="Data Science" /><category term="Associate Computational Biologist" /><summary type="html">Short stories about my professional experiences.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction</title><link href="https://jkobject.com/blog/umap-explanation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction" /><published>2019-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://jkobject.com/blog/umap-explanation</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jkobject.com/blog/umap-explanation/">&lt;p&gt;Umap is a dimensionality reduction algorithm. It takes points defined by vectors of high dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2D vector= (x,y),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3D vector= (x,y,z),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ND vector= (x,y,z,a,b,c,‚Ä¶n)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And puts them back in lower dimensions. This allows for visualizing point clouds in 2D and also finding a subspace/ base / manifold in which the cloud data lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be better seen in the 3D to 2D case. The reduced vector is also called an embedding of the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/dimred.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;scikit learn&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;View of learning the shape of a ‚Äúsheet of paper‚Äù only by knowing a set of points that lie on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other famous techniques (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@raghavan99o/principal-component-analysis-pca-explained-and-implemented-eeab7cb73b72&quot;&gt;PCA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;d&quot;&gt;MDS&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶), it learns this structure by using local information. i.e. only looking at specific patches at a time. The neighbors of each points, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@raghavan99o/principal-component-analysis-pca-explained-and-implemented-eeab7cb73b72&quot;&gt;t-SNE&lt;/a&gt;. This type of technique is called non linear as it can learn complex ‚Äúbendy‚Äù shapes (like the S above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neighbor information is better encoded into a graph. With edges representing distances between points. and only displaying the edges to the nearest points in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distance is normalized by all distances this point has to its neighbors, meaning now the range of possible distances is transformed into a [0,1] range where the closest point will be at a distance 0 and the furthest point will be at a distance computed such that summing all the distances between all neighbors will get to $log2(#neibors)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then for all the neighbors we create a set (a list of unique things) for all edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This set will be ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù, as it also contains a value representing how much each neighbors to a point is in the set of neighbors to this point, based on its distance to the center point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will do this for each point and then merge all the sets created for each point.
Meaning, we will merge the edges and keep only the ones with the lowest distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then take each edges and consider them together as a graph or a skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pausing for a second&lt;/strong&gt;, we can really see that the only thing we have done here is defined edges between points and merging them together. However you have to understand that the same edge in two different set, will have two different distances as they have both been normalized by different sets of neighbors. Thus even a point far away from everything else will get one of its edges in the graph. 
These two edges would get merged by using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/t-conorm&quot;&gt;t-conorm&lt;/a&gt; (which a fuzzy logic way of taking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)&quot;&gt;norm&lt;/a&gt; of something) on their two respective lengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that we are thinking here about graph of nodes and edges but the topological logic could be applied to the faces made by each set of 3 edges and the volumes made by each set of 4 faces, etc ‚Ä¶ This would complexify the model (and render it impossible to compute) but also make it more closer to the theory underlying it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then take the core components of this graph using &lt;a href=&quot;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_cluster_comparison.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-cluster-comparison-py&quot;&gt;spectral embedding&lt;/a&gt;, where we basically take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&quot;&gt;eigenvector&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix&quot;&gt;matrix of adjacency&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. A square of numbers where rows represent the nodes of the graph and the columns represent the same nodes and the values of the matrix are the distance between, each point)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&quot;&gt;decomposition&lt;/a&gt; of the information into two things: one that define a base for the object to exist in and the other defining the layout of the object. You need both to reconstruct the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we will only take the first 2 most important value of the base and considers it as what defines our object in 2 dimension (but it could be any other number, lower than the initial number of dimension). The two values here are vectors: they represent the 2 dimensions of each points (x,y) and each of their value/dimensions represent each of the different points in our point cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we will try to improve this first version by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization&quot;&gt;minimization&lt;/a&gt; process. There, we want to apply a physical-like force between the nodes so that close connected edges get closer together (up to a minimum distance)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/umap.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;we can see the relation to the number of samples used and the max distance to create graph edges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, there is a theoretical explanation of the algorithm that can be seen in terms of learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic&quot;&gt;fuzzy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_set&quot;&gt;simplicial sets&lt;/a&gt; defining the local structure of the high dimensional data and of the lower dimensional one and making the two sets converge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanation defined in part 2 of the paper can be understood by anyone after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=xbL11KfgiEAC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;hl=fr&amp;amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; which will allow the reader to gain the vocabulary to understand the wikipedia pages defining the vocabulary used in the paper. :p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information about Riemannian topology can then be learned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.ens.fr/~feydy/Teaching/geometrie_riemannienne_espaces_de_formes.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

I managed to get my Visa 5 hoursüïî before catching my plane and the next‚û°Ô∏è thing you know. I was in an unfurnished apartment, waiting for it all to start.
The  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/blog/broadinstitute-interview/&quot;&gt;Broad Institute&lt;/a&gt; is part of these institute a lot of people have never heardüëÇ of. Backed by billionaire philanthropist. They do cutting edge research and give their members a dream job. In that regard they compete ‚ûïmore‚ûï with the silicon valley unicornü¶Ñ than any other company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/broad1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came at the broad and did not do a Ph.D. right now for a reason. In this place I am surrounded by people coming from the best schoolsüéí in the US, they are driven and all extremely bright. See, I had never been in such an environment before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkobject.com/blog/an-internship-in-new-york/&quot;&gt;Flatiron Institute&lt;/a&gt;. But last time.. I lovedüíù it and felt I had learnt more in a couple of months than in 2 years at school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to do research, I want to have a Ph.D. I want to become an entrepreneur. I want for people to be free from diseaseüò∑ and untimely deathüíÄ. But what I know is that in order to do that I need to be surrounded with a  lot of people with a similar mindset and will. This is what I foundüîé in Boston and at the Broad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/advancedstudy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am working on a couple of subjects. I am part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancerdatascience.org/&quot;&gt;CDS&lt;/a&gt;, which work on computational analysis and prediction of Big Biological Dataset in order to better‚ùáÔ∏è understand the mechanism of the cell  in the context of humanüö∂ cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using Machine Learning, Bioinformatic and High Performance Computing in order to tackle a set of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main biological data and technique being used in our groupüë• is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturb-seq&quot;&gt;Perturbation&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, we perturb a large amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cancer-cell-line&quot;&gt;Cancer Cell Lines&lt;/a&gt; -landmark,ex patient cancerous tissue that has  evolved to live and replicate in petri dish since decades- genes by removing‚ùå them with Crispr toolsüî©, by destroying their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA&quot;&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference&quot;&gt;RNAi&lt;/a&gt;, by submitting the cells to doses of small molecules (drugs and others) and then looking üëÄ at their growthüìà rate and sequencing their transcriptome (the quantity of RNA in the cell).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/crisprscreen.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort is seconded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle&quot;&gt;CCLE&lt;/a&gt; which categorizes via many assays and toolsüî≠, each cancer cell lines„Ä∞Ô∏è. All of it belong to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://depmap.org/&quot;&gt;DepMap Project&lt;/a&gt;, around which a lot (&amp;gt;50) of secondary project gravitate. these projects are made in partnership with research lab at Harvard and MIT and with hospitals in Boston, such as the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, MGH and Boston Children‚Äôs hospitalüè•. But also with companies such as Novartis and Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been tasked in taking care of the dataüíΩ processing aspect of CCLE. with each new Cell Line release I will assay a lot of its genetic information‚ÑπÔ∏è and output it for a quarterlyüåó releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/depmapmodel.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second work has to do with the analysis of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenomics&quot;&gt;epigenome&lt;/a&gt;. Which is a set of features on the DNA that can be analyzed and used to understand how the cell is readingüìñ and processing DNA at the time of analysis. this can help inferring the program of the cell and differentiate it to any other cells in our body -which all have the same DNA sequence, however not the same function.-
In this epigenome I looküëÄ at networks of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network&quot;&gt;regulatory processes&lt;/a&gt; which involving &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhancer_(genetics)&quot;&gt;enhancers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor&quot;&gt;transcription factors&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them create a feed forward process called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772020/&quot;&gt;Core Regulatory circuitry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to understand and analyze it in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/patient/adult-aml-treatment-pdq&quot;&gt;Acute Myeloid Leukemia&lt;/a&gt; in childrenüë∂. Understanding it might help in inferring the global cellular program and thus the possible actions that can be undertaken to disrupt or reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadies as we are called  enjoy, in addition‚ûï to a life goal, an extremely decent salaries, food üç¶ everywhere (or maybe it is just the US) and talksüó® twice per day. I know.. I am spoiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I spent four days with many PIs and around twice as much students üë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì all over the world interested in computational biologyüß™ . Each of them were extremely bright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lausanne is this unique place at the center of Europe where you feel a similar atmosphere of entrepreneurship and enthusiasm and research as one would in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4096/1*Wll-nX_BACKgSLOxL07XvQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I had the chance to meet with many great researchers such as Pr. Naef working on answering fundamental questions on cellular rhythms. 
Pr. La &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lwsjpbMAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Manno&lt;/a&gt; who tries to understand the dynamics of cellular differentiation through methods of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0414-6&quot;&gt;RNA velocity&lt;/a&gt;. 
Pr. Rahi which tries to model the dynamical interaction of interaction networks in cells. 
Pr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H7Y-wqQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Barth&lt;/a&gt; which is using knowledge in protein conformation to membrane receptors applying it to cancer research and immunotherapies. 
Pr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bXoXq2AAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Manley&lt;/a&gt;, which is using methods of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-r%C3%A9solution&quot;&gt;super-resolution&lt;/a&gt; microscopy to see more about cells and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual most of them were initially trained physicists. Each of them had specific projects using machine learning which I have been able to relate to a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*gS6bJpTt8t-UpcHm3fI8Xg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had the chance to present my past research projects (that you can find on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jkobject.com&quot;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;) and which slides are available online: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.slideshare.net/jkalfon/epfl-edcb-phd-candidate-presentation&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It seems that the researchers had a good interest in me and my background which made me very proud and enthusiastic. 
Moreover I love skiingüéø and Lausanne is 45mns away from ‚Äúles pistes‚Äù. (Which is a nice üëç added bonus right?).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>J√©r√©mie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="ECE" /><category term="Computational Biology" /><category term="PhD" /><category term="Job Interview" /><category term="Epfl" /><category term="Research" /><summary type="html">During the last week of January I had the chance to enter the hiring program of EPFL‚Äôs edcb program.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Boston Interviews</title><link href="https://jkobject.com/blog/broadinstitute-interview/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Boston Interviews" /><published>2019-01-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jkobject.com/blog/broadinstitute-interview</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jkobject.com/blog/broadinstitute-interview/">&lt;p&gt;I have had the chance to fly to Boston in the last week of January to spend a day at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;Broad institute&lt;/a&gt; of MIT and Harvard. There I met with parts of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancerdatascience.org/&quot;&gt;cancer data science&lt;/a&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KnCyEE2rRoQf7xp0w76vtQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their goal is mainly to understand cancer and find new therapies by using techniques of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference&quot;&gt;RNAi screening&lt;/a&gt; / CRISPR-CAS9 screen which knocks out genes üß¨ the cell. They can then record the new cellular activity. Similarly with drugs screening. A lot of computational tools üõ† to be designed to infer the reasons and actions of such screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the chance to meet with Pr. Vasquez, Pr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5WP7REMAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Tsherniak&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eNuF408AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Dahria&lt;/a&gt;, Dr &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1SW8lOgAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;pimkin&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IUbpwKoAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Joshua&lt;/a&gt; Dempster, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jrm2Cr8AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; McFarland, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6O0QvksAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Guillaume&lt;/a&gt; kugener, Mustafa Kocak, Phil Montgomery and Jadwiga Grabarek.

&lt;p&gt;This day was intense and I only had 28hrs in Boston. The stress was obviously üôÑ high and white board questions made me feel as incompetent and stupid as they should have. However it was an amazing experience. The Broad Institute is amazing and so was Boston. I only had the chance to walk across the river, glide on the frozen water of the Boston public garden and get a humongous shake shack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting was part of my ongoing effort to find my next research environment in Computational Biologyüß™. Here the position is a job of two years as an associate computational biologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew England pretty well now but never visited Cambridge. We were hosted in a magnificent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gonvillehotel.co.uk/&quot;&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt;,üè® in front of one of Cambridge‚Äôs college. Most of the aspiring Ph.D. students there were very bright and knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is mixed with the Springer‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wellcomegenomecampus.org/&quot;&gt;welcome genome campus&lt;/a&gt; and span many designer, üë©‚Äçüé® buildings. In summer at least it felt very beautiful and lively. The researchers were in group made cubicles which would not be, to me, the best way to let people interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/8064/1*hjG7G9efRKvLrUJMputQYQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent 3 days in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One for first introductions and a very stressful interview with many PIs at the same time, filled with tricky questions. We then finished the day going to a bar and having some ‚Äúproper diner‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One with lab, üî¨ visits and a final presentation of round of questions from every PIs again. The evening was fabulous, going to one of Cambridge‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/kcuPNYx35o62&quot;&gt;oldest college&lt;/a&gt; and having the fanciest diner in a reception room, discussing with all PIs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We spent the last day with final lab visits and group selection. We then went on to visit the city, üåÉ and do canoe, üõ∂ on Cambridge‚Äôs river.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

There, I have received in the most sumptuous Cathedral, a Master of Science in Advanced Computer Science, üß™ and Computational Intelligence with Distinction from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kent.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;University of Kent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I had a lot of choice of destinations to do a double degree arrangement during my last years at ECE. I decided to choose this one as it seemed to me the best opportunity to both enter the academical system, get a degree from an english speaking country and learn about machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I went to live on the campus in what I found to be a gigantic university. My room was 10sq meters large and with only a small window showing an empty field. I cried for 10mn straight when I arrived. Coming back from a crazy internship, some conferences in Lausanne and a life in Paris‚Ä¶ it was different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I knew that everything was in my head and that if I would to put things in order and create a nice environment, I may be happy, üòÉ. There I put the distraction away, far away and I was left with myself and a will to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took courses and even 2 additional ones (out of curiosity). I got books, üìñ at the library and set in order a daily planning that filled my day entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mcBt1Ie1L0RmI4SoXWUrtQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had one, ‚òùÔ∏è plan. To produce an amazing master thesis, to learn as much as I could and to find the best possible Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy it was nice, üëç . My girlfriend, at the time, was living in London and I cam every 2 weekends to see her and spend time in the city. I was not envying her as I discover the peacefulness of Kent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*A7o8iHrsDiSkIGS5lA62gA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efforts were worth it and I would never do things differently, I discovered the British way of life with its Wittabix, pubs, 8 pints, üçªüç∫ a night, its porridges and brunches.&lt;/p&gt;

I am part of this international research group thanks to my involvement in the 2017 Young Researcher Event and 2017 Researcher Event respectively in Geneva and Lausanne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the European project to gather data, models and tools üß∞ around a unique platform and alleviate the power a supercomputer across Europe. It is designed to give researchers interested in the field, information on how to use some parts of the platform and how to create collaboration to run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and share their data and results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events I attended to were designed to showcase some researchers work on the platform and to let us learn the tools together with the researchers that designed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-involvement&quot;&gt;My Involvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*nGM0RHDgzpZ3HrCc4ZSKWw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the course of 4 days, I have focused my interest mainly on the NeuroMorphic Platform and the NeuroBotic Platform. The first one, ‚òùÔ∏è is a platform which regroups two supercomputers with radically new and different designs. The first one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiNNaker&quot;&gt;SpiNNaker&lt;/a&gt; is based in Manchester and the second one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://brainscales.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/&quot;&gt;BrainscaleS&lt;/a&gt; is based in Heideberg. In different they are creating new chip design to allow for ultra fast, large scale brain simulation. I gained now the ability to connect and run simulation on those computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NRP is a simulation interface using &lt;a href=&quot;http://gazebosim.org/&quot;&gt;gazebo&lt;/a&gt; that allows to simulate any physical environment and integrate any physical objects : houses, üè† , tables, balls, üéæ , rats, üêÄ , robots, etc..
It allows for many ways to connect your simulated animals/robots to the HBP supercomputers -making it controllable by spiking neural networks- or any other scripts and Machine Learning interfaces. Removing the need to test complex Neural Networks on &lt;a href=&quot;http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/&quot;&gt;MNIST&lt;/a&gt; data or having to create robots, ü§ñ to test it. It transforms a tedious process of creating the robots, developing the right controls and uploading/connecting the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

You can find out more about the work I did there in the Center for Computational Biology, üß™, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jkobject.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I fell in love, with New York. But that can be understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading, üìñ a lot about the work of some Professors. I then spent many month reaching out to any of them, learning in the process the best introduction, documents etc.. Many of them were not interested but still gave a lot of relevant feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reasons I got accepted to work as a research associate in the team of &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=7Bgb5TUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr&quot;&gt;Mytia&lt;/a&gt; chklovskii. This was an amazing opportunity for which I will always be thankful to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6000/1*vV0FxD2lblmeEmbU8WS6Rg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my amazement have not stopped here. The salary given in the contract was otherworldly. 5 times as much as the best internship contract given to my fellow schoolmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flatiron was on thee 5th avenue and I would be freely hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyu.edu/&quot;&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt; on Washington square. Due to unavailability of the room I however, had to spend a couple of weeks at a luxurious &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therogernewyork.com/&quot;&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt;, üè® .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a New Yorker‚Äôs life as it should be! Damn my standards just had a refresh and my friends now hated me. The lunch, ü•ô could be ordered from anywhere in Manhattan, each month had its team day. Each week had its lab cocktail, üç∏ .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XJ43R8loZLE7Ru1NzW3MFw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place was amazing but most amazingly I had the chance to eat with &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Simons&quot;&gt;Jim&lt;/a&gt; Simons and discuss about my projects and life goals and get some very good advices. The culmination fo chance, my girlfriend found at the same time an internship in New York‚Äôs french embassy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A morning routine would be to go running, üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è through washsqua, to NYU‚Äôs gym, work out, üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è , go get a free Starbucks cold brew, take a shower, üöø , dress up and skate up to the institue on the 5th avenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening was often spent in a restaurant or exploring the city. Friends, üë´ and Family came visit me and it might have been the best days of my short existence. The flatiron can be sure they will hear from me again, with two more Masters and a Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a biomedical startup which aims to implement semi biologic mitral valve through the femoral vein. Transforming complex open heart,üíì surgery into a simple ambulatory surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Oo-0K6T83Ixo8mHE.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, mitral valve insufficiency is a really commons old age disease which affects people in a spectacular way weakening every part of their body ( the typically weak old person ).
A way of treating such a problem dates from the 80s where artificial valve where placed inside of the heart through a complex open heart surgery. Such device required patients to be in a good shape -which is rarely the case- and to take anti clotting drugs for the rest of their lives.
 You can find more bout HighLife on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highlifemedical.com/&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HighLife has developed a valve made from pig tissue, cotton fabric and nitinol alloy structure. This allows the valve to be malleable at low temperature an to open up inside the patient‚Äôs anatomy. the valve is maintained in place thanks , üôè to an elastic placed around the anatomical ropes that links the valve to the bottom of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a group of only three people, HighLife has grown to 13 associates in France, üá´üá∑ and in California.
As it was a small startup I was able to meet with people from very diverse backgrounds such as biomedical engineer, material engineer, manager, heart surgeon, üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è , doctors ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HighLife Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement Procedure from Malek &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came at a point were Highlife was at the same time, testing its V1.2 valve, creating the V2 valve and delivery, üì¶ system as well as beginning clinical trials of the V1 valve.
It was a crucial moment where I had a lot to do but mainly a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-involvement&quot;&gt;My Involvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work there consisted on two things mainly. trying to develop a new Loop Placement Catheter, to deliver the elastic, that would not harm the human being. From this simple task I would need to create prototypes and simulation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solidworks.com&quot;&gt;Solidworks&lt;/a&gt; to find something that would be able to achieve the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3072/1*cpnsFeJRMyQPGRn5io2cIg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;first trial&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;first trial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a prototype where you can see the first demonstration concept on the lower images finally made it through the meticulous verification of the Highlife team. Which they are now using for the V2 LPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that I would need to dive into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appshopper.com/mac/medical/fluoroct&quot;&gt;FluoroCT&lt;/a&gt; software from which you can see a screen, üì∫ shot on the previous image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this software I was able to screen different patient‚Äôs anatomy and to simulate the curvature and tensions applied to the Valve Delivery Cather and compare it to what knowledge we had gained in animal , ü¶ì vivo tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A contrario to the upper video presenting the V1, the V2 VDC follows the same path than the LPC that you can see at the beginning of the video. I was one more time glad to hear just recently that the catheter behaved exactly as planned during the first anatomical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
