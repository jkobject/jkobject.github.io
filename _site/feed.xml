<p>Being able to model a cell with large amount of multi modal data and multi scale AI models is something I have talked about before on X and in my recent <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.29.605556v1">manuscript</a></p>

<p>To my mind there is two questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do we have the right algorithm and compute?</li>
  <li>Do we have the right data and scale?</li>
</ol>

<p>For the first part, while being just a guess, seeing the abilities of recent AI models and the scale of their deployment in both language, vision, and structural biology. It stands to reason that we might be able to model a cell with some $\epsilon$-accuracy with current software and hardware, e.g. 10^13 params model trained and doing inference on 10,000 GPUs.</p>

<p>For the second part it is harder to be as optimistic. A human body is comprised of 100 trillion cells and other microbes. All shaped by their environment. The cell doesn‚Äôt, in fact, follow the simple diagram presented in the AIVC paper:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/schema.png" alt="schema" /></p>

<p>But likely this diagram:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/aivc.jpg" alt="aivc" /></p>

<p>Proteins are not RNAs and not genes. While genes can stay the same many RNAs can come out. Same with proteins. And vice versa. Thus one cannot encode it all in one representation. They are different objects.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/true-dogma.png" alt="true dogma" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/universal-mol-representation.png" alt="universal mol representation" /></p>

<p>Is it just a modelling problem? No, and these apparent simplifications are not there by mistake. They are due to our measurement abilities or actually, inabilities. We cannot measure well these diverse proteins / RNAs nor their interactions‚Ä¶. yet #<a href="https://x.com/jkobject/status/1839993136048746565">ExSeq, #DNApaint</a>, ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>We can use AI to model proteins indeed but we knew everything about the theory of proteins, their elements and could measure and model their structures for decades prior.</p>

<p>So to me the future of AIVC is not really in the hands of the AI community but in the hands of the bio community. How do we measure these things better so as to have at least a good picture of how they work.</p>]]></content><author><name>J√©r√©mie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="PhD" /><category term="AI" /><category term="Comp-Bio" /><category term="Research" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few thoughts on the AIVC paper from the genentech team]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A year in the PhD</title><link href="https://jkobject.com/blog/a-year-in-the-phd/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A year in the PhD" /><published>2024-09-20T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-09-20T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://jkobject.com/blog/a-year-in-the-phd</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jkobject.com/blog/a-year-in-the-phd/"><![CDATA[<p>I have been a PhD student for a year now.

<p>üéâ Thrilled to share our paper on ancestry biases in CRISPR screens published in Nature Communications! This work, led by Sean Misek, reveals an important discovery about potential biases in CRISPR screening technology. You can read the full paper here: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48957-z">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48957-z</a></p>

<h2 id="how-it-started">How It Started</h2>

<p>üßê While working in the Cancer Data Science group, I was exploring ways to extract interesting new features from our CCLE omics dataset that might reveal relationships between cancer vulnerabilities and genetics.</p>

<p>üí° One unexplored avenue was computing not just the cancer mutations in our cell lines, but also the germline mutations. The reasoning was twofold: some mutations might have been wrongly categorized as somatic, and we know there exist many germline mutations that can lead to cancer.</p>

<p>üîí However, this idea faced some initial resistance as team members were concerned about releasing potentially identifiable patient-related data.</p>

<h2 id="the-discovery">The Discovery</h2>

<p>üöÄ Despite the pushback, I decided to implement the germline analysis pipeline and generate the data while awaiting the final decision on its release. Fortuitously, Sean Misek, a postdoc at the Broad, approached us with the same idea, wanting to use germline mutations for GWAS analysis.</p>

<p>üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sean‚Äôs analysis revealed surprisingly strong associations, but with genes completely unrelated to cancer. The breakthrough came when we examined how CRISPR guides were overlapping with these high association SNPs. We discovered that these SNPs were preventing the guides from binding to their target regions, creating false non-essentiality results. Even more significantly, when examining ancestry data we had recently computed, the affected cell lines were predominantly from patients of African descent.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

<p>ü§© What started as a search for new cancer targets led to the discovery of a significant bias in our CRISPR guide library affecting 1-2% of the guides. This finding has now been incorporated into our CRISPR dataset and has important implications for ensuring more equitable and accurate research outcomes.</p>

<p>This project represents a true scientific journey - starting from an initially contested idea, leading to unexpected results, and culminating in an important discovery that helps address representation issues in cancer research. üåç</p>]]></content><author><name>J√©r√©mie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="PhD" /><category term="Comp-Bio" /><category term="Research" /><category term="CRISPR" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How we discovered ancestry biases in CRISPR screens and published in Nature Communications]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Managing GRNs and What They Mean</title><link href="https://jkobject.com/blog/manage-grn-and-what-they-mean/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Managing GRNs and What They Mean" /><published>2024-06-17T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-06-17T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://jkobject.com/blog/manage-grn-and-what-they-mean</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jkobject.com/blog/manage-grn-and-what-they-mean/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="managing-grns-and-what-they-mean">Managing GRNs and What They Mean</h1>

<p>In my recent paper <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.29.605556v1">scPRINT</a>, I went into a deep dive on gene regulatory networks. Many findings are in the manuscript but I had some additional thoughts to share and wanted to present a tool I built to work with GRNs.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-gene-networks">What are Gene Networks?</h2>

<p>First we don‚Äôt use the term GRN most of the time but Gene Networks. This is because when GRNs are mentioned, they are almost always restricted to TF-gene connections. But gene expression / regulation is way more complex than this and driven by many more elements than just TFs. ‚ôæÔ∏è</p>

<p>Indeed, regulation happens with TF but also co-factors, cohesins and other proteins transporting, degrading, splicing the RNAs, shaping the DNA and working with TFs. Not only that but it is also well known that TFs themselves can be influenced and activated by pathways comprising many genes less related to transcription regulation. ü¶†</p>

<p>Finally, a new realization in biology is that regulation also happens through RNAs interacting with each others, and with the DNA. So much happening but we are fixated on TF-genes‚Ä¶ üîç</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-simple-grns">The Problem with Simple GRNs</h2>

<p>The big issue in my opinion is when these simple computationally inferred GRN are used to perform simulation of gene expression or are conflated with a model of the cell! üò≤</p>

<p>The cell is very complex and TF-gene binary connections won‚Äôt cut it, by a mile. ‚õî This is to me a big problem in the GRN and GRN inference field. We will need to better define what GRNs are and maybe use another term to talk about the TF-gene constrained networks: like TFGN instead of GRN.</p>

<p>Given all this information -and the still unknown amount of non coding RNAs in human cells- we have to accept that a true Gene Regulatory Network should implicate all RNAs, non coding RNAs, DNA regions, proteins, and likely other molecular products. üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶</p>

<p>Finally, connections are not binary, they are not weighted, molecular interactions are complex, can create complexes, partially interact and have conditionals. We will also need better representation of connections, likely using embedding representation of vertices. üîÄ</p>

<h2 id="where-do-we-go-from-here">Where Do We Go From Here?</h2>

<h3 id="1-theoretical-foundations-">1. Theoretical Foundations üìã</h3>
<p>We need good theoretical definitions that most people agree on, however murky things still are to us.</p>

<h3 id="2-better-tools-and-infrastructure-">2. Better Tools and Infrastructure üß∞</h3>
<p>We need to build tools, visualisation, data-structures, and benchmarks that represent these definitions and concepts and help us interrogate the current and future datasets we might generate. This is what I tried to start with <a href="https://github.com/cantinilab/GRnnData">GRnnData</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jkobject/benGRN">benGRN</a>. But lot more work is needed.</p>

<h3 id="3-advanced-sequencing-methods-">3. Advanced Sequencing Methods üìè</h3>
<p>We need better sequencing methods than mRNA sequencing. Single cell is only a first step but we need to measure non coding and rare RNAs with much higher precision.</p>

<p>Who knows, it might be that a large-scale, high-depth, single-cell total-RNA-sequencing methodology with correct molecular amplification / reduction methods is all that we need to understand regulation‚Ä¶ ü§î</p>

<h1 id="grnndata">GRnnData</h1>

<p>in scRNAseq data we have been fortunate to get many great python toolkits like anndata and scanpy, part of the scverse suite of tools. Allowing us to work together with a common set of standards. üìú</p>

<p>However, working with gene network methods, I have seen various ways to store them throughout the different papers and benchmarks. Often as some kind of tsv/csv/‚Ä¶ file with some kind of a gene-gene list. This lack of standard made it quite hard for me and other members of the lab to work with gene networks üôâ</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/grn1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, there is a possible standard for it! üéâAnnData contains the .varp field which is made to store var to var (e.g. genes to gene) relationships. However not many people use it‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/anndata.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I thus decided to formalize this usage by creating <a href="https://github.com/cantinilab/GRnnData">GRnnData</a>: it is basically a way to important many different gene-gene format to an AnnData file. üíÅ But it also contains more bells and whistles to work with gene networks like subsetting the network to some genes, extracting targets, and plotting the networks üíπ.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/grn2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>But <a href="https://github.com/cantinilab/GRnnData">GRnnData</a> can do more and integrates some utils functions doing things like clustering, centrality measures, enrichment and more.

<h2 id="understanding-classification-metrics">Understanding Classification Metrics</h2>

<p>When evaluating a binary classification model that outputs probabilities or has internal regularization, we need ways to assess its performance across different decision thresholds.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/auprc1.png" alt="Classification Example" /></p>

<h3 id="roc-curves">ROC Curves</h3>
<p>One common approach is plotting the ROC curve, which shows the tradeoff between true positive and false positive rates. The area under this curve (AUC/ROC-AUC/ROC/AUROC) is a popular metric:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/auprc2.png" alt="ROC Curve" /></p>

<h3 id="the-need-for-precision">The Need for Precision</h3>
<p>However, in some cases like predicting graph edges in sparse gene networks, precision becomes crucial. AUROC can miss important information about optimal cutoff points. üö´</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/auprc3.png" alt="Precision Example" /></p>

<h3 id="auprc-and-its-challenges">AUPRC and Its Challenges</h3>
<p>This is where AUPRC (PR-AUC) becomes valuable, focusing on precision and recall:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/auprc4.png" alt="AUPRC Curve" /></p>

<p>However, AUPRC comes with its own challenges: ‚ö†Ô∏è</p>

<ol>
  <li>Random precision baselines differ between tasks, making direct comparisons difficult</li>
  <li>Jagged results require careful sampling of PR curves üòü</li>
  <li>In gene network inference, many links lack prediction values, requiring special handling üî•</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="introducing-rauprc">Introducing rAUPRC</h2>

<p>To address these limitations, I developed rAUPRC, which includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Correction for random precision</li>
  <li>Proper handling of incomplete predictions</li>
  <li>A modified approach for drawing the curve from partial to complete recall</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="average-precision-ap">Average Precision (AP)</h2>

<p>AP is computed as:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/auprc5.png" alt="AP Formula" /></p>

<p>While AP is often recommended for skewed classification tasks, my rAUPRC implementation showed more consistent results across different parameters in practice.</p>]]></content><author><name>J√©r√©mie Kalfon</name><email>jkobject@gmail.com</email></author><category term="PhD" /><category term="Data-Science" /><category term="Research" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A deep dive into classification metrics and their nuances]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Enrichr, Prerank, GSEA or ssGSEA?</title><link href="https://jkobject.com/blog/enrichr-prerank-gsea/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Enrichr, Prerank, GSEA or ssGSEA?" /><published>2024-02-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-02-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://jkobject.com/blog/enrichr-prerank-gsea</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jkobject.com/blog/enrichr-prerank-gsea/"><![CDATA[<p>Bioinformatician‚Äôs main tool for discovery has often been differential expression analysis. But between Enrich, Prerank, GSEA, ssGSEA, which tool should you use? here is the quick reminder X-plainer:</p>

<p><em>Enrichr</em> is when you just have a list of genes (can be small):</p>

<p>GENEA, GENEB, GENEC</p>

<p><em>Prerank</em> is when you have values that you can rank your list of genes from:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Gene</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>GENEA</td>
      <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GENEB</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GENEC</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><em>GSEA</em> works best when you have a list of genes, with values associated with them across multiple conditions (and replicates):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Gene</th>
      <th>C1</th>
      <th>C2</th>
      <th>C3</th>
      <th>D1</th>

    <tr>

      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p><em>ssGSEA</em> is when you have many values associated with them but not 2 specific condition and want to compare 1 vs the rest</p>

<p>You can learn more about what I did <a href="https://www.jkobject.com/blog/whitelabgx-and-being-team-lead-redacted/">at WhitelabGx here</a> but I don‚Äôt think it would explain much of my decision. I will try to explain here the reasons that led me to this decision and the many lessons I learned along the way. üìöü§î</p>

<p>First, as you might be able to see in this life story of mine, I was always into science and research. I got proposed quite a few Ph.D. positions along the way. At ECE, University of Kent, EPFL, and INSERM. I applied myself to quite a few competitive places. But always found some other directions that I was more inclined to follow. It always seemed like I was pushing it for later or just thinking I could do without it. In a way I did. I went to work at the Broad Institute. Worked on many research projects, published as first-author, and even started working on my own projects. I became a research scientist in companies and even came on to lead scientists themselves during my time at Whitelab.</p>

<p>So research, although not my only passion, has always been very important to me.üß™üî¨ It always seemed obvious that I would go on and do a Ph.D. at some point. But why did I wait? Why now? ü§î</p>

<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>

<p>I was not looking for any other positions. I had in mind to stay at least a few years at Whitelab Gx, see where it had gone in that time, and then make a decision about my future.</p>

<p>However, I was in contact with Laura Cantini with whom I had discussions about Ph.D. projects before joining Whitelab. At some point, Laura came back to me with this Ph.D. proposal. I spent the good part of a month in this tough dilemma. Thinking about it in all possible ways to try and find a solution that I would not regret in the future. ü§Ø</p>

<p>I will try to explain below what led me to the decision to take this Ph.D. opportunity.
But still, I did not want to let Whitelab down. during the end of my review period, I asked for it to be extended and explained the reason why. That gave Whitelab 2.5 months to prepare for my departure. Moreover, I presented a proposition to keep an advisory role in the company during my Ph.D. and to spend a week or so preparing my substitute for the position. I also did not take any vacation between my time at Whitelab and the Ph.D. so as to give as much time to Whitelab as I could. ü§ùüìÖ</p>

<p>I believe that this goes to show my dedication and interest in the company, its mission, and the respect I have for my colleagues. üôèüè¢</p>

<h2 id="the-why">the why</h2>

<p>All the opportunities I had were very exciting to me. They were allowing me to learn in some of the best environments. At Broad Institute, I learned how to do research, biology, genomics, and cutting-edge tools and techniques.</p>

<p>At Whitelab I learned how people build companies, how to lead a team, and how to go start from scratch a unit, with a validated plan, product design, and layout a business strategy for it. From working with clients, the BD team and the management.</p>

<p>Why now? Well, there is no perfect time. But I could summarize it into 1 reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Ph.D. topic and group which I believe was a great fit for me.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously not everything can be summarized into one reason and not everything was perfect otherwise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whitelab was  maybe a bit too early stage for me? At least it is something I thought about sometimes <a href="https://www.jkobject.com/blog/whitelabgx-and-being-team-lead-redacted/">see Whitelab post</a></li>
  <li>I thought a lot about open source in computational biology and having an impact which I will be able to outline further in this post.</li>
  <li>I also had a couple  disillusions during job interviews with some high profile companies a few years back see <a href="https://www.jkobject.com/blog/leaving-broad/">leaving Broad</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, while working at Whitelab and even before that, I started to notice a change in the community. AI is slowly becoming more and more powerful and solving real biological problems. I saw it from foundation models in structural biology -with equivariant models and protein language models-, to transcriptomics and DNA language models.ü§ñüß¨</p>

<p>During my work on celligner2 -at Broad-, I could already envision how foundational models would help in many aspects of my problem and many others. Working on the Atlas at Whitelab, they were always on our minds as possible solutions to tackle some real-world scientific problems (<a href="https://www.jkobject.com/blog/whitelabgx-and-being-team-lead-redacted/">see my Whitelab post</a>). (wait for a potential paper from our team at Whitelab in ‚Äúnature computational science perspectives‚Äù) I had so many projects in mind and so little time to try to tackle them.üí°üìù</p>

<p>I also could see the speed of development of new papers and the breadth of possible research endeavors available to computational biologists. So there was some FOMO there for sure and I knew that if an AI-heavy transcriptomic research project was coming my way I might not say no.üìàüìä</p>

<p>So when I received this proposal from Laura and Gabriel I was very excited. It felt like the perfect fit for me. It had it all plus lots of applied math and stats plus gene regulatory networks which I spent years studying with Max Pimkin.üíØüìà</p>

<h3 id="issues-and-realizations">issues and realizations</h3>

<p>But this is not the only reason: Before joining Whitelab and moving to France, I had interviewed at a few companies: BenevolentAI, DeepMind, Isomorphic Labs, Owkin, and DeepLife, and applied to many more. I could see for many of them that my not having a Ph.D. was an issue.</p>

<p>Other companies, like Whitelab or Aqemia, were very clear that my experience, to them was worth much more than what most Ph.D.s would bring.</p>

<p>But this really made me realize that life would be that much tougher without this diploma and that many doors would be closed or harder to open.üö™üîê</p>

<p>Finally, working in startup companies, I noticed their needs and challenges, some of them I believe specific to European startups:</p>

<p>The funding in Europe is often much smaller than in the US. This is problematic for biotech companies that need high CAPEX from the get-go to hire the best people, do experimental validation, build experimental facilities, and create a first pipeline. This is creating a state of slower initial growth than for their American counterpart.üí∞üíº</p>

<p>This might seem to some like a small problem but it can become soul-crushing if you have been in the same company for years, waiting for it to enter exponential growth. It also can create issues, as the companies might lack important positions or teams with expertise that are harder to come by in Europe or need high investments.</p>

<p>Another realization I have had in both companies I was at, is the open-sourcing scare.üò±üì¶</p>

<h3 id="open-source-and-creating-value">Open-source and creating value</h3>

<p>Knowing biologists and Business Developers, I can guess this is an issue in many if not most (non-GAFAM) companies. ‚ÄúUse as many open source software and tutorials as you want‚Äù, ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt open source anything we do, don‚Äôt talk about anything we do‚Äù.</p>

<p>In software, since it is something that can get copied and pasted so easily, scarcity has to be artificial.
However open source and open science are often beneficial as everyone can collaborate and build on top of each other‚Äôs work. This is the inherent innovation and progress phenomena built into software development and research.üîçüåê</p>

<p>However, external pressures tend to force privacy towards innovation to keep it for oneself.ü§êüî¨</p>

<p>I would argue that for projects in which the result is very far off or unclear, not open-sourcing can be problematic. If you are building a product like a lamp, say. You cannot cheat, will the lamp turn on? For how long? For something like Facebook, even, you get usage metrics from very early on. For Biotechs, computational biology, and research, The clear-cut goal is often ‚Äúa drug that passed some clinical trials‚Äù. This creates many untangible and not very engineering-like objectives along the way like: ‚ÄúCan you get people to believe in you?‚Äù  how many partnerships do you enter?‚Äù.</p>

<p>In this context, you can lie. You can lie to the client but also to yourself. You can design a very nice-looking ‚Äúcar‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt drive at all. but since you are selling to people who don‚Äôt even really understand what is a car and what to do with it: it might be okay.üöóü§´ I am not saying that this is what we do at Whitelab at all! But it is an issue that all biotechs face and struggle with.I haven‚Äôt been the first to mention it.</p>

<p>But this is why I think open source is so important: when you let people know how to use a car, try your car, the iteration cycle is much faster. üìöüöó</p>

<p>In this context computational biologists should strive to inventivize environments where they can build things that will have a more direct impact than ‚Äúhelping make a drug‚Äù, through open source and through experimental validation.</p>

<p>This has been a big lesson learned for me too. Thinking more about impact, direct impact, and value creation. üåçüìà</p>

<h2 id="the-hard-decision">the hard decision</h2>

<p>Nothing was pushing me away from my current job and I felt welcomed, useful and that we were going forward in our grand vision <a href="https://www.jkobject.com/blog/whitelabgx-and-being-team-lead-redacted/">See the Whitelab post</a>. Choosing the Ph.D. really felt like choosing the hard thing, the hard path.</p>

<p>It is a hard decision because of how it might be seen too.
I so do not want people to see it as doing a U-turn, or as a start-over. I now have 5 years of experience in computational biology and I am afraid of hearing ‚Äúyou are just fresh out of your Ph.D. and we thus don‚Äôt think you are yet qualified for a lead role in our company.‚Äù from an HR manager after my Ph.D.üìÜüë®‚Äçüíº
To me, it is a continuation of my career. Ph.D.s can be many things and I see mine as a kind of post-doc or a long sabbatical.</p>

<p>Moreover, staying for such a short period in companies is not seen well. For very sensible reasons. But startups are a special environment, especially so early-stage. I have stayed for 3.5 years at Broad. Much longer than most people in my position there. I have worked on my project, PiPle, for more than 5 years. I also think I have shown how much I cared for Whitelab and the personal dedication I have put in and continue to, in the company. üåüü§ù</p>

<p>Finally, I feel I have actually learned a lot more in these 10 months than I had in a long time. From structural biology and drug discovery to business and management, the startup ecosystem, and cell and gene therapies. This is really thanks to these fast-paced environments and all the people I have been lucky to work with.</p>

<h2 id="the-many-lessons-learned">the many lessons learned</h2>

<p>With my previous experience in building a company, I would not have expected to learn that much from being in a startup. I think I did not realize the major steps that going from a company of 1 to 5 people is compared to 5 to 20 and 20 to 100, etc‚Ä¶ each growth cycle is a full reinvention of the company culture, it is new challenges and things get exponentially more complex for the C-levels (i.e. the executive team: CEO, CTO, CSO, CFO, HR manager, etc)</p>

<h3 id="being-a-great-c-level-in-a-startup">being a great C-level in a startup</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It shows how much of an example they are for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the 4 points I learned for the C-levels:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The C-levels‚Äô domain knowledge is key to success. üíºüß†üîë</li>
  <li>The ability to create agile processes and to hire the right people at the right time is also key to success. üîÑüë•‚è∞üîë</li>
  <li>Fostering a culture of trust and respect is how you can keep the best people in your company. ü§ùüíº</li>
</ol>

<p>It might seem obvious but I really was shocked by the Impact of C levels on a startup culture. I was shocked also by the key ‚Äúglue role‚Äù that C-levels need to play during this 1-100 people size. They are the connection between people inside the company and the partners outside it.üöÄüîó
It shows how much of an example they are for everyone.</p>

<p>But the example they set needs is a constant balancing act between everyone‚Äôs needs and goals. Within all this chaos they need to keep fostering a culture of trust and respect. This ‚Äúkeep cool‚Äù in most situations is as hard as the balancing act they constantly play. ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§Ø</p>

<p>Finally, their domain knowledge üíºüß†üîë is key to success. This requires experience in their topic and what their clients and the market want. All of this trickles down when they start hiring people: M.D.s, Ph.D.s, business developers, and engineers, with strong experience in their field are of the utmost importance in biotech. In here C levels again play a key role, who they are, the culture they have fostered allows them to recruit and keep the best people, especially when the company is still small and hasn‚Äôt reached a strong brand recognition yet.</p>

<p>Keeping good people is super tough: you need to pay them well, have their work be fulfilling while always showing them you are on a high growth trajectory. Processes and agility all play a role too. üîÑüë•‚è∞üîë Moreover, it is only through these well tought-out processes and structures that everyone‚Äôs strength and contributions can be channeled efficiently into the projects and products the company is building.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-differently-than-in-academia">Thinking differently than in academia</h3>

<p>Building a startup has many similarities with being a researcher, for example: you have ideas you need to sell through a powerful story. This is how you get people and funding. These ideas although incomplete have to convince people. You spend a lot of time finding money and building a team of experts and beginners.üí°üí∞üë•</p>

<p>But if it was that similar, every ex-PI would be a trememdous CEO. There are big differences too. The first few discussions with the BD team at Whitelab really made me understand them: First, you need to know at all times what you are selling and what people want, even though you might not have it yet. What counts is that you know you are able to have it and how you would do it.</p>

<p>Second, putting yourself out there: going to as many conferences and events, with a solution to people‚Äôs problems. This needs to happen from the get-go. (jeremie from the future here: I realize now that these 2 points are still things that many PIs would be familiar with haha)</p>

<p>Finally, your first product might be miserable, but if it solves someone‚Äôs problem, it‚Äôs okay. And thinking product first, even in comp bio, is not really a reflex. What is a product? when you see all these amazing databases, datasets, and tools. What does one bring? You don‚Äôt have to bring much initially, it just need to be useful to people. What is a product? It is really an abstraction over the work that your team does. It has to be polished, output meaningful results, within deadlines, it must have a given cost upfront‚Ä¶ üóÇÔ∏èüìÖüìã</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-cell-and-gene-therapies">The future of cell and gene therapies</h2>

<p>I joined Whitelab because I strongly believe in the future of genetic therapies. Covid opened our eyes to the power of mRNAs, while CAR-Ts have had a big impact on cancer therapies, and many more drugs are in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Especially understanding the issues that plague small molecules. It felt to me that we needed a more targeted approach for the medicine of the future.üíâüß¨üåê</p>

<p>But first, what are cell and gene therapies (CGT)s?</p>

<p>Cell and gene therapies (CGTs) represent a revolutionary approach to disease treatment, moving away from traditional methods towards more targeted and personalized solutions. These therapies work by altering the genetic material within a patient‚Äôs cells to fight or prevent disease. They can replace, remove or repair abnormal genes or introduce totally new genes to fight diseases.üß¨üíäüå°Ô∏è</p>

<p>A very famous subcategory: mRNA therapies, such as those used in some COVID-19 vaccines, are a type of gene therapy that works by introducing a small piece of mRNA into the body. This mRNA carries some instructions and once inside our cells, it uses the body‚Äôs own machinery to execute it. The advantage of mRNA therapies is that they don‚Äôt alter the DNA in our cells and are not permanent, reducing the risk of long-term side effects.üíâü¶†üß¨</p>

<p>Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are another type of CGT that work by binding to the mRNA produced by certain genes and preventing them from being translated into proteins. This can be useful for diseases where a particular gene is overactive. ASOs can be designed to target almost any gene, making them a highly versatile tool in the fight against disease.üíâüéØüß¨</p>

<p>Overall, the main advantage of CGTs is their precision. They target the root cause of diseases at the genetic level, offering the potential for more effective and longer-lasting treatments with fewer side effects. This precision, combined with the rapid advancements in technology and our understanding of the human genome, is why many believe CGTs represent the future of medicine.üíâüåçüî¨</p>

<p>I believe that since genetic sequencing and machine learning, we are able to understand the root cause of disease in the name of one or a few cell types and their disregulation caused by often one or a few genes.</p>

<p>Being able to target only these specific diseased cell types is within reach for CGTs but not for small molecules. Moreover being specific in what we are doing: what genes we are triggering is also what CGTs can do that most small molecules can‚Äôt.</p>

<p>It feels like a perfect CGT would allow us to create a novel drug in hours. From a laptop and a DNA printing machine. It would be the perfect interface between man and life.</p>

<h2 id="my-goals-and-objectives-for-the-phd">My goals and objectives for the Ph.D.</h2>

<p>A main mistake during one‚Äôs Ph.D. is to not see the time passing by. My goal for this Ph.D. is to be as product-first as I was at Whitelab. Delivering results quickly &amp; improving until it is publishable.üèÜüìäüìö</p>

<p>This mistake, thinking ‚ÄúWell I have 3 years‚Ä¶‚Äù is what makes people go overboard, finish stressed, and unprepared for what is next. Thus I plan for doing mine in 2 years. And I will prepare everything around this idea. I will also start to think about what is next ASAP.</p>

<p>To do that best, one needs to take the chance of the Ph.D. to make connections with other labs (industry or academic) on my end I am thinking for example at Broad, the Theis lab, the Yosef lab, Valence labs, ‚Ä¶ü§ùüîó</p>

<p>Moreover, a good advice I have been given is to know what you want to do and what you don‚Äôt want to do. Know what you are here for. Learn to say no. And I learned to say no in the last 4 years. My goal is to work on large models &amp; large datasets, mostly transcriptomics. But also making sure to always go back to first principles and biology.üß¨üß™üîç</p>

<p>I also know I want to make something useful, make something that can be a stepping stone for others. Something that has an impact on the community. I know that to do that you have to go the extra mile in terms of dev with and be honest with yourself about any shortcomings.</p>

<p>Finally, I have been very lucky to often become addicted to my work. I like working hard and I like challenges. But for this to happen, I need to keep enjoying what I am doing. I also wish to have no regrets about this decision.
Thus my final goal is to enjoy it, as much as I can!üòäüöÄ</p>

<h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>

<p>Thus my motto for this Ph.D. will be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>do it in 2 years and be prepared</li>
  <li>make as many connections as I can</li>
  <li>maximize impact on the community: make something useful</li>
  <li>enjoy it as much as possible</li>
</ol>

To relax and find some closure with what had happened. ‚òÆÔ∏è</p>

<p>However the day following my departure I was already looking at companies and contacting labs. üì± I was in this state where the only thing that could make me feel better was to look at the future and the possibilities. üí≠</p>

<p>But it was still tough mentally, I was thinking about the option of going back to the Broad Institute. ‚ÄúWould it be hard? Should I go now? Would it be the easy way out? What about my apartment, my girlfriend? etc.‚Äù I felt like a way out, like cowardly going back ‚Äúhome‚Äù üè† after a failed attempt.</p>

<p>I had, fortunately, all the support I could need.</p>

<p>It actually only took a week or so before I got replies. One coming from Deep Life and one from WhitelabGx.</p>

<p>I ended up being offered positions. DeepLife was very early stage at the time and its interview process made me feel a bit uneasy about things. After my previous experience, this is something I was now much more sensitive to. I was not really able to see these before.</p>

<p>Whitelab on the other hand was very welcoming. Excited about my profile and offered me a very rewarding position. I would be a team lead in Computational Biology :muscle:. Here I saw how much my previous experience was valuable as I felt I was now much more able to see in between the lines during recruitment processes. Not what people say, but how they behave, what they offer, and the way they do it. Doing so I could also see the tremendous difference in how companies can value any one person‚Äôs profile. While deep life was offering me an entry level position, after 4.5 years of experience, Whitelab was offering me a team lead position.</p>

<p>In a way, recruitment feels like friendship sometimes. It is a matter of taste, of need but most of all serendipity.</p>

<p>On the surface, the position looked a lot like what I had been told at Aqemia (although not really offered). But here, the team was already there waiting for me and the objectives were clear. ü•á</p>

<h2 id="the-environment">the environment</h2>

<p>Many things were green flags üü© for me. The company was really thinking of itself as a Biotech, the CSO was a biologist with experience. They had an HR manager. They also had a team of biologists and both the CEO / CSO were very honest, aware of what they didn‚Äôt know, and were very open to my suggestions and ideas.</p>

<p>The place itself was a brand new incubator üëÄ called Future4Care. As nice as Broad and less than 10 minutes from my place.</p>

<p>Every member of the team was nice and welcoming. It was small, however: 20 people.</p>

<p>The goal of WhitelabGx is to build a platform to help develop, de-risk, and fasten the preclinical phase of novel cell and gene therapies. The idea is to use ML and data science to drive the discovery, experimental design, and so on üìà.</p>

<p>Especially after getting experience in small molecule preclinical development, I could see the huge potential of CGTs in their precision compared to regular small molecules. I also believe strongly that many diseases will only be cured through the use of CGTs.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer:</h2>

<p>Why am I doing that?</p>

<p>It is simple: I strongly believe in openness and honesty and I think the world is a better place every time people speak freely and openly about subject matters that are important, like work.</p>

<p>I am talking here about my sole experience at WhitelabGx. With the management of 2023. This is just one point of view at one specific moment in time. I also have my own values and reference frame. Please do not use anyone‚Äôs past experience to judge a current company on this account and do your own due diligence.</p>

<p>I am not talking about anything related to IP, technology, or anything part of my non-disclosure agreement, I am only talking about my experience as I would tell it to my friends that are not in the industry.</p>

<p>Because of the nature of the subject and with respect for anyone currently working at WhitelabGx, I will keep this post private for now. If you are interested in reading it, please send out an email with an explanation of why you want to read it and who you are and I might send it to you.</p>

<p>But I might at least let you know about what WhitelabGx was very open about as of the end of 2023:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whitelab has a culture of kindness and honesty.</li>
  <li>Most people are staying in the company after their trial period.</li>
  <li>Whitelab is largely composed of people with past experience in research, biotech, and biology.</li>
  <li>Whitelab is very diverse, exactly half of the company is non-french. with people coming from all over the world. The culture is very American.</li>

I had just experienced 6 months of many failed attempts at securing positions at companies like Deepmind, BenevolentAI, Isomorphic Labs, and Owkin. I had gone through very long and tedious interview processes where for some, it had felt like I was mainly just missing a Ph.D.. Some times it felt like bad luck, bad timing.</p>

<p>But at the end of July, everything went very fast. I had gone through a couple of interviews at a young promising French startup called Aqemia and was quickly hired as a Research Scientist to start their target discovery team.</p>

<p>The pay was low compared to the US and what I was coming from (but I could have many things to say between US and Europe‚Äôs pay vs actual buying power and quality of life) and I negotiated stock options and a relocation bonus. I accepted the offer and 2 months later I was in Paris. (see more in my <a href="https://jkobject.com/blog/leaving-broad/">previous post</a>)</p>

<p>I will now try to present the time I spent at Aqemia:</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer:</h2>

<p><strong>Why am I doing that?</strong></p>

<p>It is simple: I strongly believe in openness and honesty and I think the world is a better place every time someone talks openly about subject matters that  are important, like work.</p>

<p>I am talking here about my sole experience at Aqemia with the management team of 2022. This is just one point of view at one specific moment in time. I also have my own values and reference frame that are at play. Please do not use anyone‚Äôs experience to judge a current company on this account and do your due diligence.</p>

<p>I am not talking about anything related to IP, technology, or anything part of my non-disclosure agreement, I am only talking about my experience as I would tell it to my friends that are not in the industry.</p>

<p>Because of the nature of the subject and respect for anyone currently working at Aqemia, I will keep this post private for now. If you are interested in reading it, please shout out an email and let me know why you want to read it and who you are. I might send it to you.</p>

<p>But I might at least let you know about what Aqemia was very open about as of the end of 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aqemia is a very fast-paced environment.</li>
  <li>A lot of people -more than half- leave the company after a few months. (It is not clear if this is because of Aqemia‚Äôs decisions or because of their own) (this percentage seemed higher for people with previous experience in industry and biotech).</li>
