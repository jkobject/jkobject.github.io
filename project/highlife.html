                                HighLife has been the second internship of my higher education : It was a 2 month
                                professional experience in the center of Paris.
                                It is a biomedical startup which aims to implement semi biologic
                                mitral valve through the femoral vein. Transforming complex open heart surgery into a simple ambulatory
                                surgery.

                                Today, mitral valve insufficiency is a really commons old age disease which affects people
                                in a spectacular way weakening every part of their body ( the typical weak old person ).
                                A way of treating such a problem dates from the 80s where artificial valve where placed inside of the heart
                                through a complex open heart surgery. Such device required patients to be in a good shape
                                -which is rarely the case- and to take anti clotting drugs for the rest of their lives.

                                    HighLife has developed a valve made from pig tissue, cotton fabric and nitinol alloy structure.
                                    this allows the valve to be malleable at low temperature an to open up inside the patient's anatomy.
                                    the valve is maintained in place thanks to an elastic placed around the anatomical ropes that
                                    links the valve to the bottom of the heart.
                                    From a group of only three people, HighLife has grown to 13 associates in France and in California.
                                    As it was a small startup I was able to meet with people from very diverse backgrounds such as
                                    biomedical engineer, material engineer, manager, heart surgeon, doctors ...
                                    I came at a point were highlife was at the same time, testing its V1.2 valve, creating the V2 valve
                                    and delivery system as well as beginning clinical trials of the V1 valve.
                                    It was a crucial moment where I had a lot to do but mainly a lot to learn.

                        <h3 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">My Involvement</h3>
                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--10-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding ">
                            <p>
                                My work there consisted on two things mainly. trying to develop a new Loop Placement Catheter,
                                to deliver the elastic, that would not harm the human being. From this simple task I would need to
                                create prototypes and simulation on solidworks to find something that would be able to
                                achieve the requirements. <br/>
                                Such a prototype where you can see the first demonstration concept on the lower images finally
                                made it through the meticulous verification of the Highlife team. Which they are now using
                                for the V2 LPC. <br/>
                                In addition to that I would need to dive into the FluoroCT software from which you can see a screen shot
                                on the previous image. Thanks to this software I was able to screen different patient's anatomy and to simulate
                                the curvature and tensions applied to the Valve Delivery Cather and compare it to what knowledge we had
                                gained in animal in vivo tests.
                                A contrario to the upper video presenting the V1, the V2 VDC follows the same path than the LPC
                                that you can see at the beginning of the video.<br/>
                                I was one more time glad to hear just recently that the catheter behaved exactly as planned during
                                the first anatomical trial <br/> <br/>
