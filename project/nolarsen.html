                                The NoLarsen Festival is a music festival that I managed and organised during the year2016-2017
                                as part of my student society. It gathered 2000 people and was a heavy work to pull out during an
                                intense school year. This challenge helped me learn more about myself and gave me a rigorousness in
                                my professional activities.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                My mission in this society was one of the hardest. Organizing the biggest music festival ever
                                in my campus. It had to be in the center of Paris and to gather people during a school week.
                                Our First investment was small. This festival was also a way for us to help a humanitarian organisation as we decided that
                                all of our gain should be given the Secours Populaire de France which helps homeless people and refugees
                                across France. <br/><br/>

                                I was the VP meaning the manager of this event. The constant stress for through the year and the
                                need to keep a meticulous agenda transformed me into a responsible, meticulous and involved
                                human being.
                                At its peak the team reached 50 students across multiple locations.
                                This experience was one of the most stressful and hardest in my life. Despite being far
                                from what will be my professional activity I still feel today that it was one of the experience that
                                prepared me the most for my future professional life.
